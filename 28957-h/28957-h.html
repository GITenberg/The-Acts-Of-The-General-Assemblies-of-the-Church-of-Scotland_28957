[Transcriber's Note: This 17th-century book was printed in the
typographical conventions and spelling of that time; for instance,
the printed book used the long <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></em>-shaped glyph for the letter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>,
it included old spellings such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kingdome</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">civill</span></em>,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">publick</span></em>, and old words such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hes</span></em>,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">samine</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">welas</span></em>,
and numbers generally are ended with a period.
In this transcription, archaic printing is replaced with modern characters, so
the letter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> appears as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em>, with the effect that what in
the original book would look like <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Minifters</span></em> is here transcribed
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ministers</span></em>, but archaic spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and usage are
transcribed as they appeared in the printed book.]
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It were long, neither do we
now intend, to represent,
what in the beginning, by
the Mercies of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em> and
Ministry of his faithful
Servants, was the reformation
of this Kirk: what
purity of Doctrine and
Worship, what Order, what Authority, and
what Unity continued for many years, by the
Prayers and Labours of Ministers and Professors,
what Novations and Corruptions have
been introduced upon us of late, in the time of our
Division and Detection, by such as have ever
been enemies to the Cross of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></em>, and who have
minded earthly things: How manifold and how
comfortable experience we have at this time of
the care and compassions of our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Lord</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Saviour</span></em>
preventing the utter ruine of Religion, and the
horrible vastation of this Kirk, by looking upon the
afflictions of his people, by hearing their groans,
mocked by the World: And by moving the Heart
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageii">[pg ii]</span><a name="Pgii" id="Pgii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our gracious and dread Soveraign the Kings
Majesty to conveen a free national Assembly for
redressing the wrongs done to Religion, and what
undeniable testimonies, and notable manifestations
of the divine presence and assistance of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></em>, have accompanied this meeting and whole
work. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who so is wise and observeth these things
will see the loving kindness of the Lord</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the present it seemed necessary that such of
the Acts and Constitutions of the Assembly as are
of most general concernment should be published in
print; the correct writing of so many Copies as
were called for, not being possible to be exped in due
time, and the Kirk having resolved upon this
course in former times, which, had it been keeped,
our defection through the almost invincible ignorance
of the proceedings of the Kirk, had not proven
so dangerous and deplorable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these Acts and Constitutions special regard
was had to our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">National Confession of Faith</span></span>, as
it was at first and diverse times after professed
and is now of late sworn and subscribed, that all
mens minds, who delight not to cavil, might rest
satisfied in the true meaning thereof, found out by
the diligent search of the Ecclesiastick Registers.
Our care was also rather at this time to revive
and bring to light, former laudable Acts, than to
make any new ones, reflecting as little as might
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiii">[pg iii]</span><a name="Pgiii" id="Pgiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
be upon the reformation of other Kirks, and
choosing to receive our directions from our own
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reformation</span></em>, approven by the ample testimony
of so many <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Forreign Divines</span></em>: according to
the example of the venerable Assembly at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dort</span></em>,
where special caution was, that the 30. and
31. article of the Confession of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Belgick</span></em> Kirks
touching <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastick Order</span></em> should not be examined
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Strangers</span></em>, there being a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Difference</span></em>
touching that point amongst <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reformed Kirks</span></em>,
So many as were present can bear witness
that all the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Members of the Assembly</span></em> were
many times called on, and required to propone
their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Doubts</span></em>, and to give their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Judgments</span></em> of every
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Article</span></em>, before it was Enacted, that every
one might receive <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Satisfaction</span></em>, and from the full
perswasion of his mind might give his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Voice</span></em>:
Wherin the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Unanimity</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Harmony</span></em> was the
more admirable, that many parting from their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preconceived Opinions</span></em>, which had possessed their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Minds</span></em>, did most willingly receive the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Light</span></em>, which
did now unexpectedly appear from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Records</span></em>
of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Kirk</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Extract</span></em> shall stop the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mouthes</span></em> of the
malicious, is more than we can promise, or should
be expected, We know there be some Incendiaries
who would with great joy and content of mind,
seek their lost penny in the ashes of this poor Kirk
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Kingdom: And we have already found, that
our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Laboures</span></em> and the grounds whereupon we
have proceeded, before they be seen, are misconstrued
by so many as finds their hopes blasted, and are
come short of their earthly projects: but our comfort
is that we have walked in the truth of our
hearts as in the sight of God, That the Adversaries
of the Kirk have not transformed themselves
into Angels of light, nor can say they are doing
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em> service, but are seen in their colours, and
do seek themselves, and that so many as have erred
before, not knowing the order and constitutions of
this Kirk, will as absent Children to
their mother speaking plainly and powerfully of
old and now after long silence opening her mouth
again, and uttering her mind in a free Assembly,
hear her voice, and with that reverence that
beseemeth under the supreme Majesty of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></em>,
obey her directions, that being all of one mind,
peace may be upon us, and upon the Kirk of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em>;
and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em> of peace, and love may be with us.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Reasons prooving the five Books and Registers
produced before the Assembly to be authentick</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The books now exhibited unto us underscribers, which
we have revised and perused by commission from the
generall Assembly, are true registers of the Kirk: to wit,
Five Volumes, whereof the first two contain the acts of the
Assembly, from the year of God 1560. to the year 1572.
all subscribed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Gray</span></span> Clerk. The third from the year
of God 1574. to the year 1579. The fourth from the year
of God 1586. to the year 1589. At which time <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
James Richie</span></span> was Clerk, who hath frequently written upon
the margine of the saids two last books, and subscribed the
said margine with his hand-writing. And the fifth book
being the greatest Volume, containing the acts of the generall
Assembly, from the year of God 1560. to the year 1590.
which agreeth with the foresaids other foure books and registers,
in so far as is extant in them, and further recordeth,
what is wanting by them, passing by what is mutilate
in them, and which with the two Volumes produced by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Sandilands</span></span> from the year 1590. to this present,
maketh up a perfect register.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. For the first two Volumes subscribed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ionn Gray</span></span>, albeit
it be not necessar in such antiquietie to proove that he
was Clerk, seeing he designes himself so by his subscription,
yet the same is manifest by an act mentioned in the third
book, in the time of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span>, who succeeded
him in the said office, and his hand-writ was acknowledged
by sundry old men in the ministery.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. The uniformitie of his subscriptions through both
Volumes, evident by ocular inspection above the ordinarie
custome of most famous Notars, delivers the same from all
suspicion <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in facto tam antiquo</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. There be many coppies, specially of general acts,
yet extant, which do not debord from the saids registers, but
are altogether agreeable thereto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. It is constant by the universal custome of this Kingdome,
that all registers are transmitted from one keeper to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his successour; and so comming by progresse and succession
from the first incumbent to the last possessour, are never
doubted to be the registers of that judicatorie, whereof the
last haver was Clerk; and therefore it is evident, that these
books comming successfulie from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Gray</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Nicolson</span></span>, who were all Clerks to
the Assembly, into the hands of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Robert Winrame</span></span>,
who was constitute Clerk depute by the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Robert
Nicolson</span></span> (as his deputation here present to show, will testifie)
are the undoubted registers of the Assembly: like as
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander Blair</span></span> succeeded the said
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Robert</span></span> in his place of
Clerkship to the assignations and modifications of Ministers
stipends; and during <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Robert</span></span> his life-time, was his
actual servant, and so had the said books by progresse from
him, which the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span>'s readie presently to testifie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. The two registers of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span>, albeit not
under his own hand, yet are frequently margined with his
own hand-writ, and the same marginal additions subscribed
by him, which hand-writ is seen and cognosced by famous
men, who knoweth the same, and it is evident, being
compared with his several writings and subscriptions yet
extant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. The said registers are more perfect, lesse vitiated,
scored, and interlined, then any other authentick and famous
registers of the most prime judicatories within this
Kingdom:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Sandilands</span></span>, in name of his father, who
was late Clerk by dimution of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Nicolson</span></span>, hath
produced a Volume, which proveth the saids two registers
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span> to be sufficient records; because that
same Volume is begun by that same hand, whereby the said
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span> his registers are written, and is subscribed
once in the margine by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richie</span></span> his hand, and
followed forth, and continued in the same book by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
Thomas Nicolson</span></span>, who succeeded him in the place, and was
known by most men here present to be of such approven
worth and credit, that he would never have accomplished
a register which had not been famous and true: and whereof
the hand-write, had not then been known to him sufficiently.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. That register produced by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Sandilands</span></span>,
and prosecuted by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Nicolson</span></span>, proves
the first part of that register to be true and famous, and that
first part being by ocular inspection of the same hand writ,
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Richies</span></span> registers, and subscribed in the
margine with the same hand writ, proveth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richies</span></span> two
books to be good records, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richies</span></span> registers doth approve
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grays</span></span> books by the act of Assembly before written: specially
considering the same hath come by progresse and succession
of Clerks, in the hands of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander Blair</span></span>, now living, and
here present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. The compts anent the thirds of benefices between the
Regent for the time, and the Assembly, in the second volume,
pag. 147. are subscribed by the Lord Regents own
hand, as appeareth: for it is a royall-like subscription, and
there is no hand writ in all the book like unto it, and beareth
not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sic subscribitur</span></span>, which undoubtedly it would do,
if it were a coppie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
X. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Iames Carmichell</span></span> was commanded by the generall
Assembly 1595, Sess. 9, in the book produced by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
Thomas Sandilands</span></span>, to extract the generall acts forth of
their books; and it is evident that these books are the same
which he perused for that effect, because he hath marked
therein the generall acts with a crosse, and hath designed the
act by some short expression upon the margine, which is
cognosed and known to be his hand writ, by famous and
worthy persons: which is also manifest by the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
James</span></span> his hand and subscription, written with his own hand
in the last leafe of the said books; as also acknowledged in
the said book, produced by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Thomas Sandilands</span></span>, wherein
the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Carmichell</span></span> granteth the receipt of
these, with some other books of the Assemblies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XI. The registers produced, are the registers of the Assembly,
because in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1586, the Assembly complaineth that
their registers are mutilate: which hath relation to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Richies</span></span>
third book, which is lacerat and mutilate in divers places
without any interveening of blank paper, or any mention of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hic deese</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XII. If these were not principall registers, the enemies of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the puritie of Gods worship, would never have laboured to
destroy the same which notwithstanding they have done; as
appeareth by the affixing and battering of a piece of paper
upon the margine, anent a condition of the commission not
to exceed the established discipline of this Kirk; subscribed
by the Clerk, book 3, pag. 147, and the blotting out the certification
of the excommunication against Bishop <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Adamson</span></span>,
book 4, pag. 30, who in his Recantation generally acknowledgeth
the same: but which, without that recantation,
cannot be presupposed to have been done, but by corrupt
men of intention to corrupt the books, which were not
necessary, if they were not principall registers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIII. In the Assembly 1596, the Church complained
upon the Chancelour his retention of their registers, &amp; desired
they might be delivered to their Clerk, which accordingly
was done; as a memorandum before the beginning of the first
book, bearing the redeliverie of these foure books to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
James Richie</span></span>, clerk proporteth; which clearly evinceth
that those foure books are the registers of the Assembly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIV. The said fifth book and greatest Volume, is also
marked on the margine, with the hand-writ of the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
James Carmichell</span></span>; (which is cognosced) who was appointed to
peruse the books of the Assembly as said is, and would not
have margined the same by vertue of that command, nor
extracted the general acts out of it, if it were not an approbation
therof, as an authentick and famous book.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XV. The said fifth Volume doth agree with the other
foure books; in all which is extant in them, and marketh
the blanks, which are lacerate and riven out of the same;
and compleateth all what is lacking in them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XVI. In the book of Discipline pertaining to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master
James Carmichel</span></span>, superscribed by himself, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James
Richie</span></span>, there are sundry acts and passages quoted out of the
said fifth great Volume, saying, It is written in such a page
of the book of the Assembly, which agreeth in subject and
quotation with the said fifth book, and cannot agree with
any other; so that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master James Carmichel</span></span> reviser of the Assembly
books, by their command, would not alledge that
book, nor denominate the same a book of the Assembly, if
it were not an authentick famous book.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XVII. Though the corrupt nature of man hath been
tempted to falsifie particular evidents, yet it hath never been
heard that any whole register hath ever been counterfeited;
neither can it bee presupposed that any will attempt that high
wickednesse, seeing the inducements anwerable to that
crime, can hardly be presupposed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XVIII. It is certain, and notour to all these who are
intrusted with the keeping of the publick records of the
Kingdome, that the same are never subscribed by the
Clerk, but only written and filled up by servants, and
most frequently by unknown hands, yet they and the extracts
thereof make publick faith, and the same are uncontrovertedly
authentick registers; and when the most publick
registers of the Kingdom shall be seen, and compared with
these registers of the Assembly, it shall be found that these
other registers of the most soveraigne judicatories ever unsubscribed
are more incorrect, oftner margined, scored,
and interlined, made up by greater diversitie of unknown
hand writs, than these books of the Assembly, which by
special providence are preserved so intire, that in the
judgement of any man acquainted with registers, they will
manifestly appear at the very sight to be true, famous, and
authentick.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIX. The fame and credit of ancient registers in this
Kingdome, is so much reverenced that if any extract be
different or discontinuous from the register, that extract albeit
subscribed by the person who for the time had been of
greatest eminence in the trust of registers, will be rectified,
conform to the register, and have no force, so far as it debordeth
therefrom; although the registers be written with
an obscure, unknown hand, and unsubscribed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Anent the report of the Committie, for trying the six last
pretended Assemblies: They produced in writ sundrie
reasons, clearing the unlawfulnesse and nullitie of these Assemblies;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which were confirmed by the registers of the Assembly,
the books of Presbyteries, the Kings Majesties
own letters, and by the testimonie of divers old reverend
Ministers, standing up in the Assembly, and verifying
the truth thereof. The Assembly with the universall consent
of all, after the serious examination of the reasons against every
one of these six pretended Assemblies apart, being often
urged by the Moderatour, to informe themselves thoroughly,
that without doubting, and with a full perswasion of minde,
they might give their voices, declared all these six Assemblies
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Linlithgow</span></span> 1606. and 1608,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span> 1610, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aberdeen</span></span>

to have been from the beginning unfree, unlawfull, and
null Assemblies, and never to have had, nor hereafter to
have any Ecclesiasticall authoritie, and their conclusions to
have been, and to bee of no force, vigour, nor efficacie:
Prohibited all defence and observance of them, and ordained

I. From the indiction of it. It was indicted the third of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">December</span></span> to bee kept the tenth
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">December</span></span>. And so
there was no time given to the Presbyteries, far distant,
neither for election of Commissioners nor for preparation
to those who were to be sent in Commission. The shortnesse
of the time of the indiction is proved by the Presbyterie
books of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hadingtonn</span></span>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. From the want of a lawfull calling, to these who went
to the meeting, seeing they were not at all elected by their
Presbyteries, but were injoyned to come by the Kings letters.
This also is proved by the foresaids books of the Presbyteries,
and by his Majesties letters.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. From the nature of that meeting, which was only a
private meeting, or convention, for consultation to be
taken by some persons of sundry estates written for, as the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Kings letters and the Presbyterie books do acknowledge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. From the power of those ministers who were present.
Their Presbyteries did limitate them: First, That they
should give no suffrages in that meeting as a generall Assembly.
Secondly, That they agree to nothing that may any
wayes be prejudiciall to the acts of the generall Assemblies,
or to the established discipline of the Kirk. Thirdly, That
they should not agree to resolve or conclude any question,
article, or mater whatsoever, the decision whereof is pertinent,
and proper to a free generall Assembly. Fourthly,
If any thing be concluded contrary thereunto, that they protest
against it. These limitations are clear by the Presbyterie
books.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. The acts of this meeting were not insert in the book
of Assemblies, as is evident by the register.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. The next pretended Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Linlithgow</span></span>, 1608,
doth acknowledge the Assembly, Whereof <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Master Patrick
Galloway</span></span> was Moderatour, to have been the last immediate
Assembly, preceding it selfe: and that Assembly whereof
he was moderatour, was the Assembly holden at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Halyroodhouse</span></span>,
1602. So they did not acknowledge that meeting at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Linlithgow</span></span>, 1606. for any Assembly at all. This is clear
by the registers of the Assembly, 1608, in the entrie
thereof.

I. Manie of the voters in that pretended Assembly had
no lawfull commission from the Kirk, to wit, 42
Noble men, officers of state, councellours, and Barrons,
also the Bishops, contrare to the act of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dundie</span></span>, 1597. And
one of their caveats, the Noble men, were as commissioners
from the King, the Bishops had no commission at all
from the Presbyterie, for every Presbyterie out of which
they came, had their full number of Commissioners beside
them, as the register of the Assembly beareth.

and but three ministers at most, with one Elder, Commissioners
from every Presbyterie, according to the act made
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dundie</span></span>, 1597. But in that pretended Assembly, there

and other cathedral Churches,
by keeping festival dayes, kneeling at ye Communion. Thus
their voices were prejudged by their practice of these services
before condemned by the Kirk, and therefore they should
have been secluded from voicing.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. In all lawfull Assemblies, the voicing should be
free: But in this pretended Assembly there were no free

under no lesse pain nor the wrath of authoritie, imprisonment,
banishemnt, deprivation of ministers, and utter
subversion of the state: Yea, it was plainly professed, that
neither reasoning nor the number of voices should carie

of many honest old reverend Brethren of the ministery now
present.

IX. In all lawful Assemblies, the grounds of proceeding
were, and used to be, the word of God, the confession of
Faith, and acts of former general Assemblies. But in this
pretended Assembly, the ground of their proceeding in
voicing was the Kings commandment only: For so the question
was stated: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Whether the five articles, in respect of his Majesties

unto his Majesties Royal commandements, they did agree
to the foresaids articles.

I. The Assembly having diligently considered the Book of
common prayer, lately obtruded upon the reformed
Kirk within this Realme, both in respect of the manner of
the introducing thereof, and in respect of the matter which
it containeth, findeth that it hath been devised and brought
in by the pretended Prelats, without direction from the
Kirk, and pressed upon ministers without warrand from the
Kirk, to be universally received as the only forme of divine
service under all highest paines, both civill and ecclesiasticall,
and the book it self, beside the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">popish</span></span> frame and
forms in divine worship, to containe many <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">popish</span></span> errours and
ceremonies, and the seeds of manifold and grosse superstition
and idolatrie. The Assembly therefore all in one voice,
hath rejected, and condemned and by these presents doth reject
and condemne the said book, not only as illegally introduced,
but also as repugnant to the doctrine, discipline
and order of this reformed Kirk, to the Confession of
Faith, constitutions of generall Assemblies, and acts of Parliament

II. The Assembly also, taking to their consideration the
book of Canons, and the manner how it hath been introduced,

Prelats, without warrand or direction from the generall

persons of the pretended Bishops, over the worship of
God, mens consciences, liberties and goods, and to
overthrow the whole discipline and government of the generall

the use and practise of the same; and ordains Presbyteries

III. The Assembly having considered the book of consecration
and ordination, findeth it to have been framed by
the Prelats, to have been introduced and practised without
warrand of authority, either civill or ecclesiasticall: and
that it establisheth offices in Gods house, which are not warranded
by the word of God, and are repugnant to the Discipline,
and constitutions of our Kirk, that it is an impediment
to the entrie of fit and worthie men to the ministery, and to
the discharge of their dutie after their entrie, conforme to
the discipline of our Kirk. Therefore the Assembly all
in one voice hath rejected and condemned, and by these

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Assembly taking to their most grave and serious consideration,
first the unspeakable goodnesse, and great
mercy of God, manifested to this Nation, in that so necessarie,
so difficult, and so excelent and divine work of reformation,
which was at last brought to such perfection,
that this Kirk was reformed, not only in doctrine and worship,
but also after many conferences and publick reasonings
in divers nationall Assemblies, joyned with solemne humiliations
and prayers to God, the discipline and government
of the Kirk, as the hedge and guard of the doctrine and worship,
was prescribed according to the rule of Gods word,
in the book of Policie and Discipline, agreed upon in the
Assembly 1578. and insert in the register 1581. established
by the Acts of Assemblies, by the confession of Faith, sworn
and subscribed, at the direction of the Assembly, and by
continuall practise of this Kirk: Secondly, that by mens
seeking their own things: and not the things of Jesus Christ;
divers novations have been introduced to the great disturbance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this Kirk, so firmly once compacted, and to the
endangering of Religion, and many grosse evils obtruded,
to the utter undoing of the work of reformation, and change
of the whole forme of worship and face of this Kirk; Thirdly,
that all his Majesties Subjects both Ecclesiasticall and civil,
being without consent of the Kirk, commanded to receive
with reverence a new book of common prayer, as the
only forme to be used in Gods publick worship, and the contraveeners
to be condignely censured, and punished, and
after many supplications and complaints, knowing no other
way for the preservation of Religion; were moved by God,
and drawn by necessitie, to renew the nationall <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Covenant</span></span>
of this Kirk, and Kingdome, which the Lord since hath
blessed from heaven, and to subscribe the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Confession of Faith</span></span>,
with an application thereof, abjuring the great evils wherewith
they were now pressed, and suspending the practise of
all novations formerly introduced, till they should bee tryed
in a free generall Assembly, Lastly, that some of his Majesties
Subjects of sundrie ranks, have by his Majesties commandement
subscribed and renewed the confession of Faith,
without the former application, and that both the one and
the other subscribers have subscribed the said Confession of
Faith in this year, as it was professed and according to the
meaning that it had in this Kingdome, when it was first subscribed
1581. and afterward the Assembly therefore, both
by the subscription of his Majesties high <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commissioner</span></span>, and of
the Lords of secret Councel, Septem. 22. 1638. And by
the acts of Councel, of the date foresaid, bearing that they
subscribed the said Confession, and ordaining all his Majesties
Liedges to subscribe the same, according to the foresaid
date and tennour, and as it was then professed within
this Kingdome, as likewise by the Protestation of some of
the Senatours of the Colledge of justice, when they were required
to subscribe, and by the many doubtings of his Majesties
good Subjects, especially because the subscribers of
the Confession in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February</span></span> 1635. are bound to suspend the
approbation of the corruptions of the government of the
Kirk, till they be tryed in a free generall Assembly; finding
it proper for them, and most necessary and incumbent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to them, to give out the true meaning thereof as it was at
first professed. That all his Majesties Subjects in a matter so
important; as is the publik Confession of Faith, so solemnely
sworn and subscribed, may be of one minde, and one heart,
and have full satisfaction to all their doubts, and that the
posteritie afterward may be fully perswaded of the true meaning
thereof, after earnest calling upon the name of God,
so religiously attested in the said Confession; have entered
into a diligent search of the registers of the Kirk, and books
of the generall Assembly, which the greatest part of the Assembly
had not seen before; and which by the speciall providence
of God were preserved, brought to their hands, and
publicly acknowledged to bee authentick, and have found
that in the latter confession of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>: We profess,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that we deteste all traditions brought into the Kirk without, or
against the word of God, and doctrine of this reformed Kirk</span></span>: Next,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we abhorre and deteste all contrarie religion and doctrine</span></span>, but
chiefly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">All kinds of papistry in generall &amp; particular heads, as
they were then damned &amp; confuted by the word of God, and Kirk of</span></span> Scotland,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when the said Confession was sworn and subscribed</span></span>, An. 1580.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> 1581, 1590, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span> 1591. Thirdly,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that we deteste the Romane Antichrist,
his worldly monarchie, and wicked hierarchie</span></span>: Fourthly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that we
joyn our selves to this reformed Kirk in doctrine, Faith, Religion, &amp; discipline,
promising and swearing by the great name of</span></span> GOD, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that we shall
continue in the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, and defend the
same according to our vocation and power all the dayes of our life</span></span>.

Furthermore, this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span> is distinguished in the confession
from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Popes monarchie</span></span>.
And howbeit this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span>
be called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antichrists Hierarchie</span></span>, yet it is not to distinguish
betwixt the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span> in the Popish Kirk, and any other as
lawful: But the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span>, wheresoever it is, is called
his, as the rest of the Popish corruptions are called his: To
wit, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Invocation of Saints</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">canonisation of Saints</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dedication of
Altars</span></span>, &amp;c.
are called his, not that there is another lawfull
canonization, invocation, or dedication of altars: whatsoever
corruption was in the Kirk, either in doctrine, worship,
or government since the ministry of iniquitie began
to work, and is retained, and maintained, by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pope</span></span>,
and obtruded upon the Kirk by his authority, are his. A
passage also out of the history of the councell of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trent</span></span>
was alledged, where it is related, that the Councell
would not define the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span>
by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seven orders</span></span>: we have
in our confession of Faith the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">manifold
orders</span></span> set apart and distinguished
from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hierarchie</span></span>, but as it is set down in the
cannon above cited: We have in the book of Policie or second
booke of Discipline, in the end of the second chapter,
this conclusion agreed upon. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Therefore all the ambitious titles
invented in the kingdome of Antichrist, and in his usurped HIERARCHIE
which are not of one of these four sorts, To wit,
Pastours, Doctours, Elders, and Deacons, together with offices

The Assembly remembring the uniformity of worship
which was in this Kirk, before the articles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span>, the
great rent which entered at that time, and hath continued
since, with the lamentable effects, that it hath produced
both against Pastours, and professours, the unlawfulnesse
and nullitie of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span> Assembly already declared by this Assembly,
and that in the necessarie renewing of the confession
of Faith in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February</span></span> 1638. the practice of novations introduced
in the worship of God, was suspended, till they should
be determined in a free generall Assembly: and that in the
same year at his Majesties command some had subscribed the
confession of Faith, as it was professed when it was first subscribed:
For these causes the Assembly entered into a diligent
tryall of the foresaid articles, whether they be constant
to the confession of Faith, as it was meaned and professed in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the year 1580. 1581. 1590. and 1591. And findeth that first
in generall: In the confession of Faith we professe, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We willingly
agree in our consciences to the forme of Religion, of a long time
openly professed by the Kings Majestie, and Whole body of this
Realme in all points, as unto Gods undoubted truth and verity,
grounded only upon his written word, and therefore abhor and deteste
all contrary Religion and Doctrine, but chiefly, all kinde of papistrie
in generall and partrcular heads, even as they were then
damned and confuted by the Word of God and Kirk of</span></span> Scotland, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and
in speciall the Romane Antichrist his five bastard sacraments,
with all rites, ceremonies and false doctrine, added to the ministration
of the true Sacraments, without the word of God, his cruell
judgement against Infants departing without the Sacrament, his absolute
necessitie of baptisme, and finally, we deteste all his vain allegories,
rites, signes, and traditions brought into the Kirk without,
or against the word of God, and doctrine of this true reformed Kirk,
to the which we joyne our selves willingly in Doctrine, Faith, Religion,
Discipline, and use of the holy Sacraments, as lively members
of the same in Christ our Head; promising and swearing, &amp;c.</span></span>
And that these five articles are contrarie to the Religion then

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And next in particular, concerning festivall dayes, findeth,
that in the explication of the first head, of the first
book of Discipline, it was thought good that the feasts of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christmas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Circumcision</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epiphanie</span></span>, with the feasts of the Apostles,
Martyres, and Virgine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mary</span></span>, bee utterly abolished,
because they are neither commanded nor warranded by
Scripture, and that such as observe them be punished by civill
Magistrats. Here utter abolition is craved, and not reformation
of abuses only, and that because the observation
of such feasts hath no warrand from the word of God. In
the generall Assembly holden at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1556. the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
large confession of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Helvetia</span></span> was approved, but with speciall
exception against the same five dayes, which are now urged
upon us. It was not then the Popish observation only,
with the Popish opinion of worship and merit, which was
disallowed; (for so the reformed Kirk in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Helvetia</span></span> did not
observe them) but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">simpliciter</span></span> all observation. For this end
was read a letter in Latine, sent at that time by some of our
divines to certaine divines in these parts to this purpose. In
the Assembly holden 1575. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">August</span></span>, complaint was made
against the Ministers and Readers beside <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aberdene</span></span>; because
they assembled the people to preaching and prayers upon
certane festival dayes: So that preaching and prayers upon
festival dayes was judged rebukable. It was ordained likewise,
that complaint be made to the Regent, upon the
town of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Drumfreis</span></span>, for urging and convoying a Reader to
the Kirk with Tabret and Whistle, to read Prayers, all
the holy dayes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christmas</span></span>, upon the refusal of their own
Reader. Among the articles directed by this Assembly to
the Regent: It was craved that all holy dayes hereto-fore
keeped holy, beside the Lords day, such a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yooleday</span></span>, and
Saints dayes, and such others may bee abolished, and a
certain penaltie appointed for banqueting, playing, feasting
upon these dayes. In the Assembly holden in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1577. It was ordained that the visitors with the advice
of the Synodal Assembly, should admonish Ministers,
preaching or ministrating the Communion at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Easter</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christmas</span></span>, or other like superstitious times, or Readers
reading, to desist, under the paine of deprivation. In the
ninth head of the first book of Discipline, the reason is set
down against <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Easter</span></span> Communion. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Your honours are
not ignorant how superstitiously the people run to that action at Pascheven;
as if the time gave vertue to the Sacrament, and how the rest of the
whole year, they are carelesse and negligent, as if it appartained
not to them, but at that time only. And for this reason, other times
were appointed by that book, for that holy action.</span></span> In the Assembly
holden 1596. begun in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span> 1595. at which time the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Covenant</span></span> was renewed, superstition and idolatrie breaking
forth in observing festival dayes; setting out of bone-fires,
singing Carols, are reakoned amongst the corruptions which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were to be amended: And the Pulpits did sound from time
to time, against all shew of observing any festival day whatsoever,
except the Lords day.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Concerning kneeling at the Communion, findeth that in
the confession of Faith prefixed before the Psalmes, and approved
by our Kirk in the very beginning of the reformation,
we have these words, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Neither in the ministration of the Sacraments,
must we follow men: but as Christ himself hath ordained,
so must they be ministred.</span></span> In the large confession of Faith
chap. 23. It is required as necessary, for the right ministration
of the Sacraments, that they bee ministred in such elements,
and in such sort, as God hath appointed, and that
men have adulterate the Sacraments with their own inventions:
So that no part of Christs action abideth in the originall
puritie. The judgement of our reformers, who drew up
the large Confession, was by cleare evidents shewed to be
contrary to this gesture in the act of receiving the Sacrament.
In the order of celebrating the Lords Supper, prefixed before
the Psalmes in meeter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sitting
and distributing by the Communicants</span></span>,
are joined: as likewise by the second head of the
first book of Discipline, as nearest to Christs own action, and
to his perfect practise, and most convenient to that holy action,
and all inventions devised by man are condemned, as alterations
and accusations of Christs perfect ordinance: Ministers
were enjoyned by act of Assembly in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">December 1562.</span></span>
To observe the order of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geneva</span></span>: that is the English Kirk at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geneva</span></span>: where Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Knox</span></span> had been
sometime Minister, in the ministration of the Sacraments. This act was renewed
in the Assembly holden in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">December 1564.</span></span> where Ministers
are referred to the order set down before the Psalmes,
for ministration of the Sacraments; which is all one with
the former: for that was the order of the English Kirk
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geneva</span></span>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the Parliament holden <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1567. It was declared that
whosoever did not participate of the Sacraments, as they
were then publickly administrat in this reformed Kirk ought
not to be reputed members of this Kirk. The act for the

of the Sacraments, as they were then ministred,

Confession, adhering to the use of the Sacraments, in the Kirk
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, was subscribed:
as also <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1592. after the second
Subscription to the confession of Faith. In the Parliament
1572. an act was made against such as did not participat
of the Sacraments as they were then rightly ministered:
But the gesture of kneeling, in the act of receiving, putteth
the ministration of the Sacraments used in this Kirk out of
frame: whereby it is clear that whatsoever gesture or rite,
cannot stand with the administration of the Sacraments as
they were then ministred and were ministred ever since the
reformation, till the year 1618. must bee condemned by our
Kirk as a rite added to the true ministration of the Sacraments
without the word of God, and as rite or tradition brought
in without, or against the word of God, or doctrine of this
reformed Kirk.

clause touching the civill places and power of Kirk-men, was
referred unto the tryal of this Assembly; entered into a serious
search thereof, especially of their sitting on the bench,
as Justices of peace, their sitting in Session and Councel,
their riding and voting in Parlament: and considering how
this vote in Parliament, was not at first sought nor requyred
by this Kirk, or worthy men of the Ministerie, but being
obtruded upon them, was disallowed for such reasons as
could not well be answered (as appeareth by the conference,
holden at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Halyrude-house</span></span> 1599. which with the reasons
therein contained was read in the face of the Assembly) &amp;
by plurality of voices nor being able to resist that enforced
favour, they foreseeing the dangerous consequences thereof,
in the Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Montrose</span></span> did limitate the same by
many necessare cautions: Considering also the protestation
made in the Parliament 1606 by Commissioners from Presbyteries,
and provincial Assemblies, against this restitution
of Bishops to vote in Parliament, and against all civil offices
in the persons of Pastors, separate unto the Gospel, as incompatible
with their spiritual function; with the manifold
reasons of that Protestation from the word of God, ancient
Councels, ancient and moderne Divines, from the Doctrine,
discipline and Confession of Faith of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>,
which are extant in print, and were read in the audience of
the Assembly: Considering also from their own experience
the bad fruits and great evils, which have been the inseparable
consequents of these offices, and that power in the
persons of Pastors separate to the Gospel, to the great prejudice
of the freedome and libertie of the Kirk, the jurisdiction
of her Assemblies, and the powerful fruits of their
spiritual Ministerie; The Assembly most unanimously in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one voice, with the hesitation of two allanerly, declared,
that as on the one part the Kirk and the Ministers thereof are
oblidged to give their advise and good counsel in matters
concerning the Kirk or the Conscience of any whatsomever,
to his Majestie, to the Parliament, to the Councel, or to
any members thereof, for their resolutions from the word
of God, So on the other part, that it is both in-expedient,
and unlawful in this Kirk, for Pastors separate unto the
Gospel to brook civil places, and offices, as to be Justices
of peace; sit and decerne in Councel, Session, or Exchecker;
to ride or vote in Parliament, to be Judges or Assessors
in any Civil Judicatorie: and therefore rescinds and
annuls, all contrarie acts of Assembly, namely of the Assembly
holden at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Montrose</span></span> 1600. which being prest by authority,

Assembly recommendeth unto every Kirk Session, for the
preservation of their particular Paroch from the reentrie of
the corruptions now discharged, and for their continuance
in the Covenant, anent doctrine, worship and discipline
now declared, to obtain an extract of these acts: especially
if they be printed: Seeing their pryce will no wayes then be
considerable: as the benefite both of the particular Parish,
and the interest of the whole Kirk, in the preservation thereof
from defection is undenyable: seeing Presbyteries are
composed of sundry Parochins, and so must be affected, or
infected as they are, as Provinciall and generall Assemblies
are composed of Presbyteries, and so must be diposed
as they are.

We your Majesties most humble and loyal Subjects,
The Commissioners from all the parts of this your
Majesties ancient and native Kingdome, and members of
the National Assembly, conveened at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>, by your
Majesties special indiction, considering the great happinesse
which ariseth both to Kirk and Common-wealth, by the
mutual embracements of Religion and Justice, of truth
and peace, when it pleaseth the Supreame Providence so to
dispose, that princely power and ecclesiastical authoritie
joyne in one, do with all thankfulnesse, of heart acknowledge,
with our mouthes doe confesse, and not only with
our pennes, but with all our power are readie to witnesse
unto the world, to your Majesties never dying glorie, how
much the whole Kingdome is affected, and not only refreshed,
but revived, with the comfortable sense of your Majesties
pietie, justice, and goodnesse, in hearing our humble
supplications, for a full and free general Assembly: and
remembring that for the present, a more true and real testimonie
of our unfained acknowledgement, could not proceed
from us your Majesties duetyful Subjects, then to
walke worthie of so royal a favour: It hath been our greatest
care and serious endevour, next unto the will of JESUS
CHRIST, the great King of his Kirk redeemed by his own
bloud, in all our proceedings, joyned with our hearty
prayers to GOD, for a blessing from heaven upon your
Majesties Person and government, from the first houre of
our meeting, to carie our selves in such moderation, order
and loyaltie, as beseemed the subjects of so just and gracious
a King, lacking nothing so much as your Majesties personal
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
presence: With which had we been honoured and
made happie, we were confident to have gained your Majesties
Royall approbation to our ecclesiastick constitutions,
and conclusions, knowing that a truly Christian minde and
royall heart inclined from above, to religion and piety, will
at the first discern, and discerning be deeply possessed with
the love of the ravishing beautie, and heavenly order of the
house of God; they both proceeding from the same Spirit.
But as the joy was unspeakable, and the hopes lively, which
from the fountaines of your Majesties favour did fill our
hearts, so were we not a little troubled, when wee did
perceive that your Majesties Commissioner, as before our
meeting, he did endevour a prelimitation of the Assembly
in the necessarie Members thereof, and the matters to bee
treated therein, contrarie to the intention of your Majesties
Proclamation indicting a free Assembly according to the
order of this Kirk, and laws of the Kingdome: So from
the first beginnings of our sitting (as if his Lordship had
come rather to crosse, nor to countenance our lawful proceedings,
or as we had intended any prejudice to the good
of Religion), or to your Majesties honour (which GOD
knoweth was far from our thoughts) did suffer nothing, although
most necessarie, most ordinarie, and most undenyable,
to passe without some censure, contradiction, or
protestation: And after some dayes debating of this kinde,
farre against our expectation, and to our great griefe, did
arise himself, commanded us, who had laboured in every
thing to approve our selves to GOD, and to his
Lordship, as representing your Majesties Person, to arise
also, and prohibited our further meeting by such a
proclamation, as will be found to have proceeded, rather
from an unwillingnesse that we should any longer sit, then
from any ground or reason, which may endure the tryal
either of your Majesties Parliament, or of your own royall
Judgement, unto which if (being conveened by indiction
from your Majestie, and sitting now in a constitute Assembly)
we should have given place, This Kirk and Kingdome,
contrare to your Majesties most laudable intentions manifested
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in former proclamations, and contrarie to the desires and
expectation of all your Majesties good people, had been in
an instant precipitate in such a world of confusions, and such
depths of miserie, as afterward could not easily have been
cured. In this extreamitie we made choise rather of that
course which was most agreeable to your Majesties Will revealed
unto us, after so many fervent Supplications, and
did most conduce for the good of Religion, your Majesties
honour, and the well of your Majesties Kingdome; then to
give way to any sudden motion, tending to the ruin of all:
wherein wee are so far from fearing the light, least our
deeds should be reproved, that the more accuratly that we
are tryed, and the more impartially our using of that power,
which God Almighty, and your sacred Majestie, his Vicegerent
had put in our hands, for so good and necessarie ends,
is examined, we have the greater confidence, of your Majesties
allowance and ratihabition: and so much the rather,
that being in a manner inhibited to proceed in so good a
work, we doubled our diligence, and endevoured more
carefully then before, when your Majesties <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commissioner</span></span> was
present, in every point, falling under our consideration, to
walke circumspectly, and without offence, as in the sight
of God, and as if your Majesties eyes had been looking upon
us, labouring to proceed according to the word of God,
our confession of Faith, and nationall oath, and the laudable
constitutions of the lawfull Assemblies of this Kirk; and
studying rather to renew, and revive old acts made for the
reformation of Religion, in the time of your Majesties Father,
of happie memorie, and extant in the records of the
Kirk, which divine providence hath preserved, and at this
time brought to our hands; then either to allow of such novations,
as the avarice and ambition of men, abusing authoritie
for their own ends, had without order introduced;
or to appoint any new order, which had not been formerly
received, and sworn to be reteined, in this Kirk. In all
which the members of the Assembly, found so clear and
convincing light, to their full satisfaction, against all their
doubts and difficulties, that the harmonie and unanimitie
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was rare and wonderfull, and that we could not have agreed
upon other constitutions, except wee would have been
found fighting against GOD. Your Majesties wise and
princely minde knoweth, that nothing is more ordinary
then for men, when they doe well, to bee evil spoken of,
and that the best actions of men are many times misconstrued,
and mis-reported. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Balaam</span></span>, although a false Prophet,
was wronged: for in place of that which hee said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you:</span></span> the princes of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moab</span></span> reported unto
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Balack</span></span>, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Balaam</span></span> refused to goe
with them. But our comfort is, That Truth is the daughter
of time, and although calumnie often starteth first, and
runneth before, yet Veritie followeth her at the heels, and
possesseth her self in noble and royall hearts: where base calumnie
cannot long finde place. And our confidence is,
that your Majestie with that worthie King, will keep one
eare shut against all the obloquies of men; and with that
more wise King, who when he gave a proofe that the wisedome
of GOD was in him to doe judgement, would have
both parties to stand before him at once: that hearing them
equally, they might speed best, and go out most chearfully
from his Majesties face, who had the best cause. When
your Majesties wisedome hath searched all the secrets of this
Assembly, let us be reputed the worst of all men, according
to the aspersions whith partialitie would put upon us, let us
be the most miserable of all men to the full satisfaction of the
vindictive malice of our adversaries, let us by the whole
world bee judged of all men the most unworthie to breath
any more in this your Majesties Kingdome, if the cause that
we maintaine, and have been prosecuting, shall be found any
other, but that we desire that the Majestie of GOD, who is
our fear and our dread, be served, and his house ruled, according to
his owne will; if we have not carried along with us in
all Sessions of our Assemblie, a most humble and loyall respect
to your Majesties honour, which next unto the honour
of the living GOD, lyeth nearest our hearts; if we have not
keeped our selves within the limits of our reformation,
without debording or reflecting upon the constitution of other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reformed Kirks, unto which wee heartily wish all truth
and peace, and by whose sound judgement and Christian affection
we certainly look to be approven; if we have not failed
rather by lenitie then by rigour in censuring of delinquents,
never exceeding the rules and lines prescribed,
and observed by this Kirk, and if (whatsoever men minding
themselves, suggest to the contrary) the government
and discipline of this Kirk, subscribed and sworn before, and
now acknowledged by the unanimous consent of this Assembly,
shall not bee found to serve for the advancement of
the Kindome of CHRIST, for procuring all duetifull
obedience to your Majestie, in this your Kingdome, and
great riches and glorie to your Crown, for peace to us,
your Majesties loyall subjects, and for terrour to all the
enemies of your Majesties honour and our happinesse: and
if any act hath proceeded from us, so farre as our understanding
could reach, and humane infirmitie would suffer
which being duely examined according to the grounds laid
by your Majesties Father, of everlasting memory, and our
religious Progenitours, and which Religion did forbid us
to infringe, shall merit the anger and indignation, wherewith
wee are so often threatned: But on the contrare, having
sincerely sought the glorie of GOD, the good of Religion,
your Majesties honour, the censure of impietie, and of
men who had sold themselves to wickednesse, and the reestablishment
of the right constitution and government of
this Kirk, farre from the smallest appearance of wronging
any other reformed Kirk, we humbly beg, and certainly
expect, that from the bright beames of your Majesties
countenance shining on this your Majesties own Kingdome
and people, all our stormes shall bee changed in a comfortable
calme, and sweet Sun-shine, and that your Majesties
ratification in the ensuing Parliament, graciously indicted
by your Majesties Proclamation to bee keeped in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May</span></span>, shall
setle us in such a firmnesse, and stabilitie in our Religion,
as shall adde a further lustre unto your Majesties glorious
Diadem, and make us a blessed people under your Majesties
long and prosperous reigne; which we beseech him who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hath directed us in our affaires, and by whom Kings reigne,
to grant unto your Majestie, to the admiration of all the
world, the astonishment of your enemies, and comfort of
the godly.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Kings Majestie having graciously declared, That it
is His Royal will and pleasure, that all questions about
Religion, and matters Ecclesiastical be determined by Assemblies
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Kirk, having also by publike Proclamation
indicted this free national Assembly, for setling the present
distraction of this Kirk, and for establishing a perfect peace,
against such divisions and disordres as have been sore displeasing
to his Majestie, and grievous to all his good Subjects.
And now his Majesties Commissioner <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span>
Earle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Traquair</span></span>,
intrusted and authorized with a full Commission, being present,
and sitting in this Assembly, now fully conveened
and orderly constitute in all the members thereof, according
to the order of this Kirk, having at large declared His
Majesties zeal to the reformed Religion, and His Royal
care and tender affection to this Kirk, where His Majestie
had both His Birth and Baptisme, His great displeasure at
the manifold distractions and divisions of this Kirk and
Kingdome, and His desires to have all our wounds perfectly
cured with a fair and fatherly hand: And although in the
way approven by this Kirk, tryal hath been taken in former
Assemblies before from the Kirk registers, to our full satisfaction,
yet the Commissioners Grace making particular
enquiry from the members of the Assembly, now solemnly
conveened, concerning the real and true causes of so many &amp;
great evils as this time past had so sore troubled the peace of
this Kirk and Kingdome, It was represented to his Majesties
Commissioner by this Assembly, That beside many other,
the maine and most material causes were, First, The pressing
of this Kirk, by the Prelates with a Service Book, or Book of
Common Prayer, without warrand or direction from the
Kirk, and containing beside the Popish frame thereof, diverse
Popish errors and ceremonies, &amp; the seeds of manifold grosse
Superstitions and Idolatry, with a Book of Canons, without
warrand or direction from the general Assembly, establishing
tyrannicall power over the Kirk in the person of Bishops,
and overthrowing the whole discipline &amp; government of the
Kirk by Assemblies, with a Book of Consecration and Ordination,
without warrand of Authoritie, Civill or Ecclesiasticall,
appointing offices in the house of God, which are not
warranted by the word of God, and repugnant to the discipline
and Acts of our Kirk, and with the high Commission,
erected without the consent of the Kirk, subverting the jurisdiction
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and ordinary Judicatories of this Kirk, and giving
to persons meerely Ecclesiasticall, the power of both swords,
and to persons meerly Civill, the power of the Keys
and Kirk-sensures. A second cause was the Articles of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>
the observation of Festivall dayes, kneeling at
the Communion, Confirmation, Administration of the
Sacraments in private places, which are brought in by a null
Assembly and are contrary to the Confession of Faith, as it
was meant and subscribed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span> 1580, and divers times since
and to the order and constitutions of this Kirk. Thirdly,
the changing of the government of the Kirk, from the Assemblies
of the Kirk to the persons of some Kirkmen, usurping
prioritie and power over their Brethren by the way,
and under the name of Episcopall government against the
Confession of Faith, 1580 against the order set downe in the
Book of Policy, and against the intention &amp; constitution
of this Kirk from the beginning. Fourthly the Civill places
and power of Kirkmen, their sitting in Session, Councell
and Exchequer, their Riding, Sitting, and voting in Parliament,
and their sitting in the Bench as Justices of peace,
which according to the constitutions of this Kirk are incompatible
with their spiritual function, lifting them up above
their Brethren in worldly pomp, and do tend to the hinderance
of the Ministrie. Fiftly the keeping and authorizing
corrupt Assemblies at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Linlithgow</span></span>, 1606. and 1608. At
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>, 1610. At <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aberdene</span></span>,
1616. At S. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrews</span></span>, 1617. At
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span>, 1618. which ar null and unlawful, as being called
and constitute quite contrary to the order and constitutions
of this Kirk received and practised ever since the reformation
of Religion, and withal laboring to introduce novations
into this Kirk, against the order and religion established.
A sixth cause is the want of lawful &amp; free General Assemblies,
rightly constitute of Pastors, Doctors, and Elders yearly,
or oftner <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro re nata</span></span>, according to the libertie of this Kirk,
expressed in the Book of Policy: and acknowledged in the
Act of Parliament, 1592. After which the whole Assembly
in one heart and voyce did declare, that these and such
other, proceeding from the neglect and breach of the Nationall
Covenant of this Kirk and Kingdome, made in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1580. have been indeed the true and maine causes of all
our evills and distractions. And therefore ordain, according
to the constitutions of the Generall Assemblies of
this Kirk: And upon the grounds <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">respectivè</span></span> above-specified,
That the foresaid Service-Book, Books of Cannons,
and Ordinaination, and the high Commission, be
still rejected: that the Articles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span>, be no more practised:
That Episcopall Government, and the Civill places
and power of Kirk-men be holden still as unlawfull in this
Kirk: That the above named pretended Assemblies, At
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Linlithgow</span></span> 1606. and 1608.
At <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span> 1610. At <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aberdene</span></span>
1616. At S. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrews</span></span> 1617.
At <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Perth</span></span> 1618. be hereafter
accounted as null, and of none effect. And that for preservation
of Religion, and preventing all such evill in time-coming,
Generall Assemblies rightly constitute, as the proper
and competent judge of all matters Ecclesiasticall, heereafter
be kept yearly and oftner, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro re nata</span></span>, as occasion and
necessity shall require; The necessity of these occasionall
Assemblies being first remonstrate to His Majestie by humble
supplication: As also that Kirk Sessions, Presbyteries
and Synodall Assemblies, be constitute and observed, according
to the order of this Kirk.

favours bestowed upon us by His Majestie, and that there
resteth nothing for crowning of His Majesties incomparable
goodnesse towards us, but that all the members of this Kirk
and Kingdom be joyned in one and the same Confession and
Covenant with God, with the Kings Majestie, and amongst
ourselves: And conceiving the main lett and impediment
to this so good a work, and so much wished by all, to have
been the Informations made to his Majestie, of our intentions
to shake off Civil and dutiful obedience due to Soveraignity,
and to diminish the Kings greatnesse and authoritie,
and being most willing and desirous to remove this and
all such impediments which may hinder and impede so full
and perfect an Union, and for clearing of our loyaltie,
WEE in our own names, and in name of all the rest of the
Subjects and Congregations whom we represent, do now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in all humility represent to your Grace, His Majesties Commissioner,

that we never had nor have any thought of with-drawing
our selves from that humble and dutiful obedience to His
Majestie, and to his Government, which by the descent
&amp; under the reign of 107 Kings is most chearfully acknowledged
by us and our predecessors: And that we never had,
nor have any intention nor desire to attempt any thing that
may tend to dishonour of God, or the diminution of the
Kings greatnesse and authoritie: But on the contrary, acknowledging
our quietnesse, stabilitie and happinesse to
depend upon the safety of the Kings Maj. Person, &amp; maintenance
of His greatnesse and Royal authority who is Gods
Vice-gerent set over us, for the maintenance of Religion
and ministration of Justice, We have solemnly sworn and
do sweare, not only our mutual concurrence and assistance
for the cause of Religion, and to the uttermost of our power,
with our means and lives, to stand to the defence of our
dread Soveraigne, his Person and authority, in preservation
and defence of the true Religion, Liberties and Lawes
of this Kirk and Kingdome, but also in every cause which
may concerne His Majesties honour, shall according to the
Lawes of this Kingdome, and the duties of good Subjects
concurre with our friends and followers in quiet manner,
or in armes, as we shall be required of His Majestie, His
Councel, or any having his Authority. And therefore
being most desirous to cleare our selves of all imputation
of this kinde, and following the laudable example of our
predecessors, 1589. do most humble supplicate your Grace,
His Majesties Commissioner, and the Lords of His Majesties
most honourable privie Councell, to enjoyn by Act

King so just and religious, that it is not only lawfull for us
to be Christians under Your Majesties government, which
sometime hath been the greatest praise of great Princes, but

Trustie and welbeloved, Wee greet you
well. It is no small part of Our Royall
care and desires, that the true Reformed
Religion, wherein by the grace of God,
We resolve to live and dye, be settled
peaceably in that Our ancient and native
Kingdome of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, and that the same
be truly taught, and universally received and professed by
Our Subjects there, of all degrees. For preventing of all
division and trouble hereafter, We did intend in Our Own
Royall Person, to have been present at this Assembly; but
conceiving it to be unfitting, to detaine the Ministers from
their particular charges, till the time of Our coming to the
Parliament. We have resolved to make knowne unto you
by these, and by Our Commissioner, That in the approaching
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Parliament, it is Our intention by Our authority, to
ratifie and confirm the Constitutions of the late Assembly at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>, that they may be obeyed by all Our Subjects
living in that Our Kingdome. And that We will take into
Our Royall consideration, by what meanes the Churches
belonging to Our presentation, when any of them shall happen
to need, may be best provided with well qualified Preachers:
Like as We are not unwilling, to grant presentations
unto such as in these times of trouble have entred into
the Ministerie, providing they have been examined by the
Presbyteries, and approved by them: Because We want not
Our own feares of the decay of Learning in that Church and
Kingdome, We intend also to consider of the best meanes
for helping the Scooles and Colledges of Learning especially
of Divinity, that there may be such a number of Preachers
there, as that each Parish having a Minister, and the
Gospel being preached in the most remote parts of the Kingdome,
all Our Subjects may taste of Our care in that kinde,
and have more and more cause to blesse God that we are set
over them. And finally, so tender is Our care, that it shall
not be Our fault if the Churches and Colledges there flourish
not in Learning and Religion: For which Royall testimonie
of Our goodnesse, We require nothing upon your part, but
that which God hath bound you unto, even that you be
faithfull in the charge committed unto you, and care for
the soules of the people: That you study Peace and Unity
amongst your selves, and amongst the people, against all
Schisme and Faction; and that you not only pray for Us,
but that you teach the People, which We trust are not unwilling
to pay that honour and obedience which they owe
unto Us, as his Vicegerent set over them, for their good;
wherein We expect you will by your good example goe before
them. Which hoping you will doe, We bid you farewell.

The Assembly seriously considering the present case and
condition of this Kirk and Kingdome, what great
things the Lord hath done for us, especially since the renewing
of our Covenant, notwithstanding our former backsliding
and desertion; and if we shall either become remisse
in the dueties of Piety, or shall not constantly hold and
keep our Religion, unto which we have bound ourselves so
straitly and solemnly, what dishonour we doe unto the
Name of God before men, who have their eyes upon us,
and how great judgements we bring upon our selves, upon
these and the like considerations, The Assembly doth finde
it most necessary to stirre up themselves, and to provoke all
others both Ministers and people of all degrees, not only to
the religious exercises of publike worship in the Congregation,
and of private worship in their families, and of every
one by themselves apart, but also to the duteies of mutual
edification, by instruction, admonition, exhorting one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
another to fordwardnesse in Religion, and comforting one
another in whatsoever distresse; and that in all their meetings,
whither in the way of civill conversation, or by reason
of their particular callings, or any other occasion offered by
divine providence, no corrupt communication proceed out
of their mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying,
that it may minister grace unto the hearers: And because
the best means have been, and may still be despised or
abused, and particularly the duetie of mutual edification,
which hath been so little in use, and so few know how to
practise in the right manner, may be upon the one part subject
to the mocking of ungodly and worldly men, who cannot
endure that in others, which they are not willing to practise
themselves, and upon the other part, to many errors
and abuses, to which the godly through their weaknes may
fall, or by the craftinesse of others may be drawn into,
such as are Error, Heresie, Schisme, Scandal, Self-conceit,
and despising of others, pressing above the common
calling of Christians, and usurping that which is proper to
the Pastoral Vocation, contempt or misregard of the publike
means idle and unprofitable questions which edifie not,
uncharitable censurings, neglect of duties in particular callings,
businesse in other mens Matters and Callings, and
many such others in doctrine, charity, and manners, which
have dolefully rent the bowels of other Kirks, to the great
prejudice of the Gospel.

Therefore the Assembly, moved with the zeal of God against
all abuses and corruptions, and according to their
manifold obligations, most earnestly desiring and thirsting
to promove the work of Reformation, and to have the comfort
and power of true godlinesse sensible to every soul,
and Religion to be universally practised in every Family, and
by every person at all occasions, Doth charge all the Ministers
and Members of this Kirk whom they doe represent,
that according to their several places and vocations, they
endeavour to suppresse all impiety and mocking of religious
exercises, especially of such as put foule aspersions, and
factious or odious names upon the godly. And upon the
other part, that in the fear of God they be aware and spiritually

wise, that under the name and pretext of religious
exercises, otherwayes lawful and necessary, they fall not
into the aforesaid abuses; especially, that they eschew all
meetings which are apt to breed Error, Scandall, Schisme,
neglect of dueties and particular callings, and such other
evils as are the works, not of the spirit, but of the flesh,
and are contrary to truth and peace; and that the Presbyteries

the one way or the other.

Wee most heartily salute you in the Lord, rejoycing
with you in his unspeakable goodnesse, so miraculously
prospering your late endeavours, both for the restoring
and settling of your own Liberties and Priviledges, in
Church and common wealth (which we heare and hope he
is now about to accomplish) as also for the occasioning and
advancing of the Worke of Reformation among our selves;
for which as we daily blesse the highest Lord, sole Author
of all one good, so doe we acknowledge your selves worthy
Instruments thereof. And for that (besides all other respects)
doe, and ever shall (by the help of God) hold
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you deare unto us, as our own bowels, and our selves obliged

And now (dear Brethren) forasmuch as the Church of
Christ is but one body, each part whereof cannot but partake
in the weale and woe of the whole, and of Each other part;
and these Churches of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>,
may seem both to be imbarqued in the same bottome, to sink and swim together,
and are so near conjoyned by many strong tyes, not
only as fellow members under the same Head Christ, and
fellow-subjects under the same King; but also by such
neighbour-hood and vicinity of place, that if any evil shall
much infest the one, the other cannot bee altogether free:
Or if for the present it should, yet in processe of time it
would sensibly suffer also. And forasmuch as evils are better
remedied in their first beginning, then after they have
once taken deep root; therefore we whose names are here
under-written, in the behalf of our selves, and of many
others, Ministers of the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> be bold to commend
to your consideration; (being met together in this venerable
Assembly) a difference of great concernment,
which you may please (in brief) thus to understand. Almighty
God having now of his infinite goodnesse raised up
our hopes of removing the yoke of Episcopacie (under
which we have so long groaned) sundry other forms of
Church-government are by sundry sorts of men projected,
to be set up in the roome thereof: One of which (amongst
others) is of some Brethren that hold the whole power of
Church-government, &amp; all Acts thereunto appertaining (as
Election, Ordination, and Deposition of Officers, with Admission,
Excommunication &amp; Absolution of Members) are
by divine Ordinance <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in foro externo</span></span>, to be decreed by the most
voices, in, and of every particular Congregation, which
(say they) is the utmost bound of a particular Church: endued
with power of Government, &amp; only some Formalities
of solemne execution to be reserved to the Officers (as servants
of the saids Church) if they have any, or if none, then
to be performed by some other members, not in office,
whom the said Church shal appoint thereunto, And that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every of the said particular Congregations (whether they
consists of few or many Members, and be furnished with
Offices or not) lawfull: may &amp; ought to transact, determine
&amp; execute all matters pertaining to the government of themselves
amongst &amp; within themselves without any authoritative
(though not consulatory) concurrence or interposition of any
other persons or Churches whatsoever, condemning all imperative
and decisive power of Classes, or compound Presbyteries
and Synods, as a meere usurpation. Now because
we conceive that your judgement in this case may conduce
much by the blessing of God, to the settling of this question
amongst us; Therefore we doe earnestly intreat the same at
your hands, and that so much the rather, because we sometimes
hear from those of the aforesaid judgement, that some
famous and eminent Brethren, even amongst your selves,
doe somewhat encline unto an approbation of that way of
government. Thus humbly craving pardon for our boldnesse,
leaving the matter to your grave considerations, and
expecting answer at your convenient leasure, We commit
you, and the successe of this your meeting, to the blessing
of the Almighty, in whom we shall ever remain.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We have learned by long experience, ever since the time
of the Reformation, and specially after the two Kingdomes have
been (in the great goodnesse of God to both) united
under one Head and Monarch, but most of all of late,
which is not unknown to you, what danger and contagion
in matters of Kirk-government, of divine worship, and of
doctrine, may come from the one Kirk to the other, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
beside all other reasons make us to pray to God, and to desire
you, and all that love the honour of Christ, and the peace
of these Kirks and Kingdomes, heartily to endeavour,
that there might be in both Kirks, one Confession, one
Directory for publicke worship, one Catechisme, and one
Forme of Kirk-government. And if the Lord who hath
done great things for us, shall be pleased to hearken unto our
desires, and to accept of our endeavours, we shall not only
have a sure foundation for a durable Peace, but shall be
strong in God, against the rising or spreading of Heresie
and Schisme amongst our selves, and of invasion from forraine
enemies.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Concerning the different Formes of Kirk-government,
projected by sundrie sorts of men, to be set up in place of
Episcopall Hierarchie, which we trust is brought near unto
its period, we must confesse, that we are not a little grieved
that any godly Ministers and Brethren should be found, who
doe not agree with other Reformed Kirks in the point of government
as well as in the matter of Doctrine and worship;
and that we want not our own feares, that where the hedge
of Discipline and Government is different, the Doctrine and
Worship shall not long continue the same without change:
yet doe not marvell much, that particular Kirks and Congregations
which live in such places, as that they can conveniently
have no dependencie upon superiour Assemblies,
should stand for a kind of independencie and supremacie in
themselves, they not considering that in a nation or Kingdome,
professing the same Religion, the government of the
Kirk by compound Presbyteries and Synods is a help and
strength, and not a hinderance or prejudice to particular
Congregations and Elderships, in all the parts of Kirk-government;
and that Presbyteries and Synods are not an extrinsecall
power set over particular Kirks, like unto Episcopal
dominion, they being no more to be reputed extrinsecal
unto the particular Kirks, nor the power of a Parliament,
or Convention of Estates, where the Shires and Cities have
their own Delegates, is to be held extrinsecal to any particular
Shire or City.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our unanimous judgement and uniforme practice, is,
that according to the order of the Reformed Kirks, and
the ordinance of God in his Word, not onely the solemne
execution of Ecclesiastical power and authoritie, but the
whole acts and exercise thereof, do properly belong unto
the Officers of the Kirk; yet so that in matters of chiefest
importance, the tacite consent of the Congregation be had,
before their decrees and sentences receive final execution,
and that the Officers of a particular Congregation, may not
exercise this power independently, but with subordination
unto greater Presbyteries and Synods, Provincial and National:
Which as they are representative of the particular
Kirks conjoyned together in one under their government;
so their determination, when they proceed orderly, whether
in causes common to all, or many of the Kirks, or in
causes brought before them by appellations or references
from the inferiour, in the case of aberation of the inferiour,
is to the several Congregations authoritative and obligatorie
and not consultatory only: And this dependencie and subordination,
we conceive not only to be warranted by the
light of nature, which doth direct the Kirk in such things
as are common to other societies, or to be a prudential way
for Reformation, and for the preservation of Truth and
Peace, against Schisme, Heresie, and Tyranny, which is
the sweet fruits of this government wheresoever hath
place, and which we have found in ancient and late experience;
but also to be grounded upon the Word of God,
and to be conforme to the paterne of the Primitive and Apostolical
Kirks: And without which, neither could the
Kirks in this Kingdome have been reformed, nor were we
able for any time to preserve Truth and Unity amongst us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this forme of Kirk-government, our unanimity and
harmony by the mercy of God, is so full and perfect, that
all the Members of this Assembly have declared themselves
to be of one heart, and of one soule, and to be no lesse
perswaded, that it is of God, then that Episcopal government
is of men; resolving by the grace of God, to hold

In the midst of Our great and weighty affaires of
Our other kingdoms, which God Almighty, who
is privie to Our Intentions, and in whom We
trust, will in his own time bring to a wished and
peaceable conclusion, We are not unmindfull of
that duetie which we owe to that Our ancient and native Kingdome,
and to the Kirks there, now met together by their
Commissioners in a Nationall Assembly. God whose Vice-gerent
We are, hath made Us a King over divers Kingdomes,
and We have no other desire, nor designe, but to
govern them by their own Lawes, and the Kirks in them by
their own Canons and Constitutions. Where any thing is
found to be amisse, We will endeavour a Reformation in a
fair and orderly way; and where a Reformation is settled,
We resolve, with that authoritie where with God hath in vested
Us, to maintain and defend it in peace and libertie, against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all trouble that can come from without, and against all Heresies,
Sects, and Schismes which may arise from within.
Nor do We desire any thing more in that Kingdom (and
when We shall hear of it, it shall be a delight and matter of
gladnesse unto Us) then that the Gospel be faithfully preached
throughout the whole Kingdom, to the outmost skirts
and borders thereof. Knowing that to be the mean of honour
to God, of happinesse to the people, and of true obedience
to Us. And for this effect, that holy and able men
be put in places of the Ministery, and that Schooles and Colledges
may flourish in Learning and true Pietie. Some
things for advancing of those ends, We did of Our own accord
promise in Our Letters to the last Assembly, and
We make your selves Judges, who were witnesses to
Our Actions, while We were there in Person, whether
we did not perform them both in the point of presentations
which are in our hands, and in the liberall provision of
all the Universities and Colledges of the Kingdome, not
only above that which any of Our Progenitors had done
before Us, but also above your owne hopes and expectation.
We doe not make commemoration of this Our Beneficence,
either to please Ourselves, or to stop the influence
of Our Royal goodnesse and Bountie for afterward, but that
by these reall demonstrations of Our unfained desires and delight
to do good, you may be the more confident to expect
from Us, whatsoever in Justice We can grant, or what may
be expedient for you to obtaine. We have given expresse
charge to Our Commissioner, to see that all things be done
there orderly and peaceably, as if We were present in Our
Own Person; not doubting but in thankfulnesse for your
present estate and condition, you will abstaine from every
thing that may make any new disturbance, and that you will
be more wise then to be the enemies of your own peace,
which would but stumble others, and ruine your selves.
We have also commanded Our Commissioner to receive
from you your just and reasonable desires, for what may
further serve for the good of Religion, that taking them to
Our consideration, We may omit nothing which may witnesse
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Us to be indeed a nursing Father of that Kirk, wherein
We were born and baptized, and that if ye be not happy,
you may blame not Us, but your selves. And now
what doe We again require of you, but that which otherwise
you owe to Us as your Soveraigne Lord and King, even
that ye pray for Our prosperitie and the peace of Our Kingdomes,
that ye use the best meanes to keep Our People in
obedience to Us and Our Lawes, which doth very much
in Our personall absence from that Our Kingdom depend
upon your preaching, and your owne exemplary loyaltie
and faithfulnesse, and that against all such jealousies, suspitions,
and sinister rumors as are too frequent in these times,
and have been often falsified in time past, by the reality
of the contrary events: Ye judge Us and Our professions
by Our actions, which we trust through God in despight of
malice shall ever go on in a constant way for the good of
Religion, and the weal of Our People, which is the
Chiefest of Our intentions and desires. And thus We bid
you farewell. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Given at Our Court at</span></span> Leicester,

this day at length beares. And suchlike whereas the Lords
of Exchequer upon a Petition presented to them by the
Commissioners of the Generall Assembly, and the Procurator
and Agent for the Kirk representing two Prejudices;
one, that gifts obtained from His Majestie of Patronages of
Kirks, at His Presentation were passing the Exchequer,
without the qualification and provision of a List, wherewith
His Majestie was pleased to restrict himself; and the other,
that some were seeking gifts of patronage of Bishop-Kirks,
which we declared to belong to Presbyteries, to be planted
by two Acts of the late Parliament, The saids Lords have
ordained that no signatory containing gifts of patronages
from His Majestie, shall passe hereafter, but with a speciall
provision that the same shall be lyable to the tenor of His Majesties
said Declaration. Ordaining also the Procurator &amp; Agent
of the Kirk to be advertised, &amp; to have place to see all signaters
whatsoever, containing any patronage, to the effect
they may represent the interest of the Kirk therein; as the said
Act of the date the 27 of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span> last, registrate also in the Books
of Assembly, this day at length beares. Therefore that the saids
Kirks which now are, or which were at his Majesties presentation
the sayd third day of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">January</span></span> last, may be the better
provided with able Ministers, when the samine shall vaik,
The Assembly ordaines that hereafter every Presbyterie
shall give up yearly a Roll of the ablest of their Expectants,
to their Synods; and that the Synods select out of these Rolls
such persons whom they in certain knowledge judge most fit
for the Ministrie and worthiest of the first place, With Power
to the Synods to adde or alter these Rolls given by the
Presbyteries, as they thinke reasonable: And that the Synods
shall send the Rolls made by them in this manner, to the next
Generall Assembly, who shall also examine the Rolls of the
Synods, and adde or alter the same as shall be thought expedient.
Which Roll made by the Generall Assembly, shall be
sent to every Presbyterie &amp; that the Presbyterie, with consent
of the most or best part of the Congregation, shall make a
List of six persons willing to accept of the presentation out of
that Roll of the Assembly, upon every occasion of vacation of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any Kirk within their bounds, and shall send the samine together
with a blank presentation: The which (if His Majesty
be Patron to the vacant Kirk) shall be sent by the said Procurator
and Agent, to such as the Commissioners of the Generall
Assembly, or in their absence the Presbyterie of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>:
shall direct and think at that time most able and willing
to obtain the presentation, to be signed and filled up by His
Maj. choise of one of the List. And if the vacant Kirk be of a
Patronage disponed by His Majesty since the 3. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">January</span></span>,
in that case either the Presbyteries themselves shall send a
List of six persons in maner aforesaid, with a blank presentation
to the Patron, to be filled up by his choise, &amp; subscribed
or send the samine to the saids Officers of the Kirk, to be conveyed
by them to the Patron of the vaiking Kirk, as the Presbyterie
shall think most expedient. It is always declared,
that this order shall be without prejudice to the Presbyteries,
with consent foresaid, to put actual Ministers upon the said
List of six persons, to be sent to the Patron of the said vaiking
Kirks, if they please. And least that the nomination of Expectants
by Presbyteries, Synods, or Assemblies, in their Rolls
or Lists foresaid, be mis-interpreted, as though the Expectants
nominated in these Rolls and Lists, were thereby holden &amp;
acknowledged to be qualified, which is not the intention of
the Assembly, who rather think, that in respect of this Order,
there should be a more exact tryal of Expectants then before:
Therefore the Assembly ordaines, that no Expectants shall be
put on the Rolls or Lists above-mentioned, but such as have
been upon the publike exercise, at the least by the space of half
a year, or longer, as the Presbyterie shall finde necessary. And
suchlike ordaines, that hereafter none be admitted to the publike
exercise, before they be tried according to the tryal appointed
for Expectants, at their entrie to the Ministerie in the
late Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>, in the 24. Article of the Act of the 23.
Session thereof: which tryall of the Assembly appoints to be
taken of every Expectant, before his admission to the publike
exercise. And suchlike ordaines, That the samine tryall
shall be again taken immediatly before their admission to the
Ministerie, together with their triall mentioned in the advice
of some Brethren deputed for penning the corruptions of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>. And because that Kirks of the patronages
foresaids, will vaik before the Rolls and Lists be made
up by the Presbyteries, Synods, and General Assemblies,
in manner foresaid: Therefore in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">interim</span></span> the Assembly
ordains the Commissioners of every Presbyterie here present,
to give in a List of the ablest Expectants within their bounds,
the morn, to the Clerk of the Assembly, that the Assembly
may out of these Rolls, make a List to be sent to every
Presbyterie: Out of which the Presbyteries shall make a List
of six persons, with consent foresaid, and send the samine upon
vacancie of any Church within their bounds, together with a
presentation to His Majestie, or any other patron, in manner
foresaid. And because the Procurator and Agent of the
Kirk cannot get sufficient information to the Lords of Exchequer
anent the Right and Interest of the Kirk, and Presbyteries
in Kirks, whereof gifts of patronages may be presented
to the Exchequer: Therefore the Assembly ordaines for their
better information hereanent, that every Presbyterie, with
all diligence, use all meanes of exact tryall of the nature and
qualitie of all Kirks within their bounds, as what Kirks belong
to the Kings Majesties patronage, what to other Laick patronages,

In Our answer to a Declaration sent by the now Commissioners
of this Kingdom from both Houses of Parliament, we
have not onely pressed this point of unity in Religion and
Uniformity of Church government, as a meane of a firme
and durable union betwixt the two Kingdomes, and without
which former experiences put us out of hope long to enjoy
the puritie of the Gospel with Peace, but also have rendred
the reasons of our hopes and confidence, as from other
considerations, so from Your Majesties late Letter to this
Assembly, that Your Majestie in a happy conjunction with
the Houses of Parliament, will be pleased to settle this blessed
Reformation, with so earnestly desired a Peace in all
Your Dominions. And therfore we Your Majesties most loving Subjects,
in name of the whole Kirks of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, represented

humbly and earnestly beg, that Your Majesty in the deep of
Your Royall Wisdom, and from Your affection to the true
Religion, and the Peace of Your Kingdoms, may be moved
to consider, that the God of Heaven and Earth is calling
for this Reformation at Your hands, and that as you are his
Vice-gerent, so You may be his prime Instrument in it. If it
shall please the Lord (which is our desire and hope) that
this blessed unitie in Religion and Uniformity in Government
shall be brought about; Your Majesties Conscience, in
performing of so great a dutie: shall be a well-spring of comfort
to Your Self, Your memory shall be a sweet favour, and
Your name renowned to all following generations. And if
these unhappy commotions and divisions shall end in this
peace and unity; then it shall appeare in the Providence of
God, they were but the noyse of many waters, and the voyce
of a great thunder before the voyce of harpers harping with
their harps, which shall fill this whole Iland with melodie
and mirth, and the name of it shall be, THE LORD
IS THERE.

The Lords and Commons in this present Parliament assembled,
finding to their great grief, that the distractions
of this Kingdome dayly increase, and that the wicked
Counsels and practises of a malignent party amongst us (if
God prevent them not) are like to cast this nation into bloud
and confusion, To testifie to all the World how earnestly
they desire to avoid a Civill Warre, they have addressed
themselves in an humble Supplication to His Majestie, for
the prevention thereof. A Copy of which their petition,
they have thought fit to send at this time to the National Assembly
of the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, to the intent that that
Church and Kingdome (whereunto they are united by so
many and so near bounds and tyes, as well Spiritual as Civil)
may see that the like minde is now in them, that formerly
appeared to be in that Nation. And that they are as tender
of the effusion of Christian bloud on the one side, as they are
zealous on the other side of a due Reformation both in
Church and State. In which work, whilest they were labouring,
they have been interrupted by the plots and practises
of a malignant party of Papists, and ill affected persons,
especially of the corrupt and dissolute Clergy, by
the incitement and instigation of Bishops and others,
whose avarice and ambition being not able to bear the Reformation
endeavoured by the Parliament, they have laboured
(as we can expect little better fruit from such
trees) to kindle a flame, and raise a combustion within
the bowels of this Kingdom: Which if by our humble
supplication to His Majesty it may be prevented, and
that according to our earnest desire therein, all Force and
Warlike preparations being laid aside, we may returne to a
peaceable parliamentary proceeding, We do not doubt,
but that by the blessing of Almighty God upon our endeavours,
we shall settle the matters both in Church and State,
to the encrease of His Majesties honour and State, the peace
and prosperitie of this Kingdome, and especially to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
glory of God, by the advancement of the true Religion,
and such a Reformation of the Church, as shall be most agreeable
to Gods Word. Out of all which, there will also most
undoubtedly result a most firme &amp; stable Union between the
two Kingdomes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, which according

The Generall Assembly of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> having received
a Declaration sent unto them by the Commissioners
of this Kingdome, now at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, from the Honourable

they have of so wise and honourable a meeting as is the Parliament
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, did require; have with universall consent
resolved upon this following Answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. That from the recent sense of the goodnesse of God,
in their own late deliverance, and from their earnest desire
of all happinesse to our native King and that Kingdome, they
blesse the Lord for preserving them in the midst of so many
unhappy divisions and troubles from a bloudy Intestine War,
which is from God the greatest Judgement, and to such a
nation the compend of all calamities. They also give God
thanks for their former and present desires of a Reformation,
especially of Religion, which is the glory and strength of a
Kingdome, and bringeth with it all temporall blessings of
prosperity and peace.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. That the hearts of all the Members of this Assembly,
and of all the wel-affected within this Kingdome, are exceedingly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
grieved and made heavy, that in so long a time,
against the professions both of King and Parliament, and
contrary to the joynt desires and prayers of the godly in both
Kingdomes, to whom it is more deare and precious then
what is dearest to them in the world, the Reformation of
Religion hath moved so slowly, and suffered so great interruption.
They consider that not only Prelates, formall
Professours, profane and worldly men, and all that are Popishly
affected, are bad councellours and workers, and do
abuse their power, and bend all their strength and policies
against the Work of God; but the God of this world also,
with Principalities and powers, the rulers of the darknesse
of this world, and spiritual wickednesse in high places, are
working with all their force and fraud in the same opposition,
not without hope of successe, they having prevailed so
farre from the beginning, That in the times of the best
Kings of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Juda</span></span> of old, and the most part of the Reformed
Kirks of late, a through and perfect Reformation of Religion
hath been a work full of difficulties, Yet doe they
conceive, that as it ought first of all to be intended so
should it be above all other things, with confidence in God,
who is greater then the World, and he who is in the World,
most seriously endeavoured. And that when the supream providence
giveth opportunity of the accepted time &amp; day of salvation,
no other work can prosper in the hands of his servants,
if it be not apprehended, &amp; with all reverence &amp; faithfulnesse
improved. This Kirk and Nation, when the Lord gave them
the calling, considered not their own deadnesse, nor staggered
at the promise through unbelief, but gave glory to God.
And who knoweth (we speak it in humility and love, and
from no other mind then from a desire of the blessing of God
upon our King and that Kingdome) but the Lord hath now
some controversie with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, which will not be removed,
till first and before all, the worship of his name and the government
of his house be settled according to his own will?
When this desire shall come, it shall be to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> after so
long deferred hopes, a tree of life, which shall not only
yeeld temporell blessings unto themselves, but also shall
spread the branches so far, that both this nation and other reformed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Kirks shall finde the fruits thereof to their great satisfaction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. The Commissioners of this Kingdome in the late
Treaty of peace, considering that Religion is not only the
meane of the service of God and saving of Souls, but is also
the base and foundation of Kingdomes and Estates, and the
strongest band to tye Subjects to their Prince in true loyaltie,
and to knit the hearts of one to another in true unity and
love, They did with preface of all due respect and reverence,
far from arrogancy or presumption, represent in
name of this Kingdome, their serious thoughts and earnest
desires for unity of Religion, That in all His Majesties Dominions,
there might be one Confession of Faith, one directory
of worship, one publike Catechisme, and one form of
Kirk Government. This they conceived to be acceptable to
God Almighty, who delighteth to see his People walking
in truth and unity, to be a speciall meanes for conserving of
peace betwixt the Kingdomes, of easing the Kings Majesty,
and the publike government of much trouble, which ariseth
from differences of Religion, very grievous to Kings
and Estates, of great content to the King himself, to his
Nobles, his Court, and all his people, when (occasioned
to be abroad) without scruple to themselves, or scandal to
others; all may resort to the same publike worship, as if
they were at their own dwellings; of suppressing the names
of Heresies, and Sects, Puritans, Conformists, Separatists,
Anabaptists, &amp;c. Which do rent asunder the bowels
both of Kirk and Kingdome, of despaire of successe to Papists
and Recusants, to have their profession, which is inconsistent
with the true Protestant Religion, and authority
of Princes, setup again, and of drawing the hearts and
hands of Ministers, from unpleasant and unprofitable Controversies,
to the pressing of mortification, and to Treatises
of true pietie, and practical Divinity. The Assembly doth
now enter upon the labour of the Commissioners, unto
which they are encouraged, not only by their faithfulnesse
in the late Treaty, but also by the zeale and example of the
Generall Assemblies of this Kirk in former times, as may
appeare by the Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Decemb. 25.</span></span> in the

year 1566. which ordained a Letter to be sent to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
against the Surplice, Tippet, Cornercap, and such other

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">April 24. 1583.</span></span>
humbly desiring the Kings Majesty to command his Ambassadour,
then going to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, to deale with the Queen,
that there might be an Union and Band betwixt them &amp; other
Christian Princes &amp; Realmes, professing the true Religion for
defence and protection of the Word of God, and Professors
thereof, against the persecution of Papists and confederates
joyned and united together by the bloudy league of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Trent</span></span>: as
also that his Majesty would disburden their brethren of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
of the yoke of Ceremonies, imposed upon them, against
the liberty of the Word: And by the Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March 3. 1589.</span></span> ordaining the
Presbyterie of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span> to
use all good and possible means for the relief and comfort
of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, then heavily troubled for the maintaining
the true discipline and government of the Kirk, and
that the Brethren in their private and publike prayers, recommend
the estate of the afflicted Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> to God,
While now by the mercy of God the conjunction of the two
Kingdomes is many wayes increased, the zeale of the Generall
Assembly towards their happinesse ought to be no lesse.
But besides these, the Assembly is much encouraged unto
this duetie, both from the Kings Majesty and his Parliament,
joyntly, in their Answer to the proposition, made by the late
Commissioners of the Treaty, in these words: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">To their desire
concerning unity of Religion, and uniformity of Kirk government as
a speciall meanes for conserving of peace betwixt the two Kingdomes,
upon the grounds and reasons contained in the paper of the</span></span>
10 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></span>
March, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and given in to the treatie and Parliament of</span></span> England:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is answered upon the</span></span> 15.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></span> June, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That his Majestie with advise,
of both Houses of Parliament doth approve of the affection of His Subjects
of</span></span> Scotland <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in their desire of having conformitie of Kirk
government between the two Nations, and as the Parliament hath already
taken into consideration the Reformation of Kirk government, so
they will proceed therein in due time, as shall best conduce to the glory of
God, the peace of the Kirk, and of both Kingdomes.</span></span> And also severally:
for His Majestie knoweth that the custodie and vindication,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the conservation and purgation of Religion, are a
great part of the duetie of Civill authority and power. His
Majesties late practise while he was here in person, in resorting
frequently to the exercises of publike worship, His
Royall actions, in establishing the worship and government
of this Kirk in Parliament, and in giving order for a competent
maintenance to the Ministery and Seminaries of the
Kirk, and His Majesties gracious Letter to the Assembly (seconded
by the speech of His Majesties Commissioner) which
containes this religious expression: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Where any thing is amisse,
we will endeavour a Reformation in a fair and orderly way,
and where Reformation is settled, we resolve with that authority
wherewith God hath vested us, to maintain and defend it in peace
and liberty, against all trouble that can come from without, and
against all Heresies, Sects, and Schismes, wich may arise from
within.</span></span> All these doe make us hopeful that His Majestie
will not oppose, but advance the work of Reformation. In
like manner the Honourable Houses of Parliament, as they
have many times before witnessed their zeale, so now also
in their Declaration sent to the Assembly, which not only
sheweth the constancy of their zeale, but their great grief
that the worke hath been interrupted by a malignant party
of Papists and evill affected persons, especially of the corrupt
and dissolute Clergie, by the incitement and instigation
of Bishops and others, their hope according to their earnest
desire, when they shall returne to a peaceable and Parliamentary
proceding, by the blessing of God, to settle such a
Reformation in the Church, as shall be agreeable to Gods
word, and that the result shall be a most firm and stable union
between the two Kingdoms of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, &amp;c. The
Assembly also is not a little encouraged by a Letter sent from
many reverend Brethren of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, expressing
their prayers and endeavours against every thing which shall
be found prejudiciall to the establishment of the Kingdome
of Christ, and the Peace of their Soveraigne. Upon these
encouragements, and having so patent a doore of hope, the
Assembly doth confidently expect, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> will now
bestirre themselves in the best way for a Reformation of Religion,
and do most willingly offer their prayers and utter-endeavours
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for furthering so great a Work, wherein Christ
is so much concerned in his glory, the King in his honour,
the Kirk and Kingdome of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> in their happinesse, and
this Kirk and Kingdome in the purity and peace of the
Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. That the Assembly also from so many reall invitations,
are heartened to renew the Proposition made by the
aforenamed Commissioners of this Kingdome, for beginning
the Work of Reformation, at the uniformity of Kirk-government.
For what hope can there be of Unity in Religion,
of one Confession of Faith, one Form of Worship,
&amp; one Catechisme, till there be first one Forme of Ecclesiasticall
Government? Yea, what hope can the Kingdome and
Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> have of a firme and durable Peace, till Prelacie,
which hath been the main cause of their miseries and
troubles, first and last, be plucked up, root and branch, as
a plant which God hath not planted, and from which, no
better fruits can be expected then such sower grapes, as this
day set on edge the Kingdome of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. The Prelaticall Hierarchie being put out of the way,
the Work will be easie, without forcing of any conscience,
to settle in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> the government of the Reformed Kirks
by Assemblies. For although the Reformed Kirks do hold,
without doubting, their Kirk Officers, and Kirk government
by Assemblies higher and lower, in their strong and
beautifull subordination, to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">jure divinio</span></span>, and perpetuall: yet
Prelacie, as it differeth from the Office of a Pastor, is almost
universally acknowledged by the Prelates themselves, and
their adherents, to be but an humane ordinance, introduced
by humane reason, and settled by humane Law and Custome
for supposed convenience: which therefore by humane
authority, without wronging any mans conscience, may
be altred and abolished upon so great a necessity, as is a hearty
conjunction with all the Reformed Kirks, a firm and well
grounded Peace betwixt the two Kingdomes, formerly divided
in themselves, and betwixt themselves by this partition
wall and a perfect Union of the Kirks in the two Nations:
which although by the providence of God in one Hand, &amp;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
under one Monarch, yet ever since the Reformation, and
for the present also, are at greater difference in the point of
Kirk-government, which in all places hath a more powerfull influence
upon all the parts of Religion, then any other Reformed
Kirks, although in Nations at greatest distance, and under
divers Princes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. What may be required of the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> for
furthering the Work of Uniformitie of Government, or for
agreeing upon a common Confession of Faith, Catechisme,
and directory for Worship, shall according to the order given
by this Assembly, be most willingly performed by Us,
who long extreamly for the day when King and Parliament
shall joyn for bringing to passe so great, so good a Work,
That all Warres and Commotions ceasing, all Superstition,
Idolatry, Heresie, Sects, and Schismes being removed, as
the Lord is one, so his name may be one amongst us; and
mercy and truth, righteousnesse and peace meeting together,
and kissing one another, may dwell in this Iland.

thereof to the next Generall Assembly.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. No transportation would be granted hereafter without
citation of parties having interest (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the Minister
who is sought and his Parish) to hear what they can oppose,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

(occurring first) agree not; or if there be appeale
made from it, then the matter is to come to the Generall

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. A Minister may be transplanted from a particular
Congregation (where he can onely doe good to a part) to
such a place, where he may benefit the whole Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>
because, in reason the whole is to be preferred to a
part, such as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Because all the great Justice Courts sit there, as Councell,
Session, Justice Generall, Exchequer, &amp;c. and it
concerns the whole Kirk, that these Fountains of Justice be
kept clean, both in the point of Faith, and Manners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Because there is great confluence to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>, from
time to time, of many of the chief Members of the whole
Kingdome, and it concerns the whole Kirk to have these
well seasoned, who (apparantly) are to be the Instruments
of keeping this Kirk and Kingdome in good temper.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this may be the more easily done, the Assembly
first recommends to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>, that some young men of excellent
spirits may be (upon the charges of the said Town)
trained up, at home or abroad, toward the Ministery from
time to time. Secondly we meane not, that all the places
of the Ministrie of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span> be filled with Ministers to be
transported by Authority of this Act, but only till they be
provided of one Minister (transplanted by the Authority of
the Assembly) for every Kirk in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>, and that the
rest of the places be filled either according to the Generall
Rules of transportation for the whole Kingdome, or by
agreement with actuall Ministers, and their Parishes, with
consent of the Presbyterie or Synod, to the which they
belong.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. In the next roome, we finde, that it is a transporting of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ministers for publike good, that Colledges, (having the
profession of Divinitie) be wel provided of professors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherin the Colledge of Divinitie in S. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrews</span></span> is first
to be served without taking any Professors or Ministers
out of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburg</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aberdene</span></span>, and then the rest of
the Colledges, would be provided for, as their necessity
shal require: yet (in respect of the present scarcity) it were
good for the Universities to send abroad for able and approved
men, to be Professors of Divinitie, that our Ministers
may be kept in their pastoriall charge as much as may be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Towns also wherein Colledges are, are very considerable
in the matter of transportation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Also Congregations, where Noblemen have chief
residence are to be regarded, whether planted or unplanted,
and a care is to be had, that none be admitted Ministers
where Popish Noblemen reside, but such as are able men
(especially for controversies) by sight of the Presbyterie:
and moreover it is necessary, that such Minesters as dwell
where Popish Noblemen are, and are not able for controversies,
that they be transported.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. They who desire the transportation of a Minister
should be obliged to give reasons for their desire: Neither
should any Presbyterie or Assembly, passe a sentence for transportation
of any Minister, till they give reasons for the expediencie
of the same, both to him and his Congregation, &amp;c.
to the Presbyterie whereof he is a member. If they acquiesce
to the reasons given, it is so much the better: if they
doe not acquiesce, yet the Presbyterie, or Assembly, (by
giving such reasons before the passing of their sentence) shal
make it manifest, that what they doe is not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro arbritratu, vel
imperio</span></span> onely, but upon grounds of reason.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. Because there is such scarcity of Ministers having the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iris</span></span> tongue, necessity requires, that when they be found in
the Low-lands, they be transported to the High-lands: providing
their condition be not made worse, but rather better
by their transportation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. In the point of voluntary transportation, no Minister
shal transact and agree with any Parish, to be transsported
thereto, without a full hearing of him, and his Parish, before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Presbyterie to which he belongs in his present
charge, or superiour Kirk judicatories, if need shall be.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. The planting of vacant Kirks, is not to be tyed to
any (either Ministers, or Expectants) within a Presbyterie:
but a free election is to be; according to the order of our
Kirk, and Lawes of our Kingdome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. The chief Burghs of the Kingdome are to be desired
to traine up young men of excellent spirits for the ministery,
according to their power, as was recommended to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>:
Which course will in time (God willing) prevent many
transplantations.

their judgements thereof to the next General
Assembly, as said is.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. Every Parish would have a Reader and a Schoole, where
Children are to be bred, in reading, writing, and
grounds of Religion, according to the laudable Acts, both
of Kirk and Parliament, made before.

II. Anent these Schooles, every Minister with his Elders
shall give accompt to the Presbyteries at the visitation
of the Kirk: The Presbyteries are to make report to the Synode,

are planted, as above said, and how they are provided with
men and means.

III. And because this hath been most neglected in the

High-lands, Ilands, and borders. Therefore the Ministers
of every Parish are to instruct by their Commissioners, to the
next General Assembly, that this course is begun betwixt
and then: and they are further to certifie from one General

omission, or not.

IV. And because the means hitherto named or appointed

would further supplicate this Parliament that they (in
their wisdome) would finde out how meanes shall be had
for so good an use, especially that the Children of poore
men, being very capable of learning, and of good engines,
may be trained up, according as the exigence and necessity
of every place shall require. And that the Commissioners,
who shall be named by this Assembly, to wait upon the Parliament
may be appointed to represent this to his Majestie,

Therefore the Assembly ordains all Ministers, especially in these

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We received with much joy and satisfaction the Answer
which your General Assembly vouchsafed us to our Letters
of the last yeer. Some of us in the name of our Brethren,
thought it then fit by Mr. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander Henderson</span></span> (a Brother
so justly approved by you, and honoured by us) to return
our deserved thanks. And we now further think it equall
upon this occasion, to make a more publike acknowledgement
of such a publike favour. You were then pleased to
give us fair grounds, to expect that brotherly advice and
endeavours, which the common cause of Christ, and the mutual
interest of the united Nations, command us now again
to ask, if not to chalenge. We doubt not but your experience,
together with your intelligence, abundantly informes
you of our condition, what various administrations
of providence we have passed through and we still lye
betwixt hopes and feares, a fit temper for working; the
God of all grace enable us to improve it. As our hopes are
not such as may make us fear, so neither doe our Feares prevail,
to the casting away our confidence. Your own late condition,
together with this Declaration of ours present, may
acquaint you with the certain, though subtil, authors &amp; fomentors
of these our confused conflicts: which we conceive
to be the Hierarchical faction, who have no way to peace &amp; safety,
but through the trouble &amp; danger of others. Our prayers
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and endeavours, according to our measure, have been and
shall be for the supplanting and rooting up whatsoever we
finde so prejudicial to the establishment of the Kingdome
of Christ, and the peace of our Soveraigne. And that this
Declaration of ourselves may not leave you unsatisfied, we
think it necessary further to expresse, That the desire of the
most godly and considerable part amongst us, is, That the
Presbyterian Government, which hath just and evident
Foundation both in the Word of God, and religious reason,
may be established amongst us, and that (according to your
intimation) we may agree in one confession of Faith, one
directorie of Worship, one publike Catechisme and form
of Governement: Which things, if they were accomplished,
we should much rejoyce in our happy subjection to
Christ our Head, and our desired association with you our
beloved brethren. For the better effecting whereof, we
thought it necessary, not only to acquaint you with what
our desires are in themselves, but likewise to you, that is,
That what way shall seem most fit to the wisedom of that
grave and religious Assembly, may be taken for the furtherance
of our indeavours in this kind. We understand that
our Parliament hath been before hand with us in this intimation,
and it cannot but be our duty, who are so much concerned
in the businenesse, to adde what power the Lord hath
given us with you to the same purpose. This designe and
desire of ours hath enemies on the Left-hand; and dissenting
brethren on the Right; but we doubt not, that as our
hearts justifie us that our intentions are right, and such as
we conceive tend most to the glory of God, and the peace
of the Churches of the Saints; so (by your brotherly concurrence
in the most speedy and effectuall way you can find
out) the Work will in Gods due time receive a prayed for,
hoped for issue. We shall not need by many arguments
from mutuall Nationall interest (though we know you will
not overlook them) to inforce this request, the firme
bond wherewith we are all united in our Lord Jesus Christ,
we are assured will alone engage your faithfull endeavours
in this businesse. To him we commit you, with these
great and important affairs you have in hand. Be pleased to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accept of these as the expression of the mindes of our many
godly and faithfull Brethren, whose hearts we doubt not
of, neither need you, though their hands in regard of the
suddennesse of this opportunity could not be subscribed together
with ours, who are.

By our Answer to the Declaration sent unto us from the
honourable Houses of Parliament, ye may perceive that
your Letter which came into our hands so seasonably, was
not only acceptable unto us, but hath also encouraged us to
renew both to the Kings Majestie and the Houses of Parliament,
The desires of the late Commissioners of this Kingdome
for Unity in Religion, in the four particulars remembred
by you, we cannot be ignorant but the opposition from
Satan and worldly men in Kirk and Policy, will still be vehement
as it hath been already, But we are confident
through our Lord Jesus Christ, that the prayers and indeavours
of the godly in both Kingdoms, will bring the work
to a wished, and blessed Issue. This whole national Kirk
is so much concerned in that Reformation and Unity of Religion
in both Kingdomes, that without it we cannot hope
for any long time to enjoy our puritie and peace, which
hath cost us so dear, and is now our chiefest comfort and
greatest treasure: Which one cause (beside the Honour of
God, and the happinesse of the People of God in that Kingdome,
more desired of us then Our lives) is more then
sufficient to move us, To contribute all that is in our power
for bringing it to passe. And since we have with so great liberty
made our desires and hopes known both to King and
Parliament, it is a duety incombent both to you and us, who
make mention of the Lord, and are Watch-men upon the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Walls of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></span>, never more to keep silence nor to hold
our peace day nor night, till the Righteousnesse of Sion go
forth as brightnesse, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
burneth. And if it shall please the Lord to move the hearts
of King and Parliament, to hearken unto the motion, for
which end we have resolved to keep a solemne Fast and Humiliation
in all the Kirks of this Kingdome, the mean by
which we have prevailed in times past, we wish that the Work
may be begun with speed, and prosecuted with diligence
by the joint labours of some Divines in both Kingdoms,
who may prepare the same for the view and examination of
a more frequent Ecclesiastick meeting of the best affected to
Reformation there, and of the Commissioners of the General
Assembly here, that in end it may have the approbation
of the Generall Assembly here, and of all the Kirks there,
in the best way that may be, we wish &amp; hope at last in a nationall
Assembly; Our Commissioners at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>, shall in

great a Work, which we with our heart and our soule

That where your Petitioners, by the great blessing of the
Lord, enjoyed for a little while a peaceable and fruitfull
Ministerie of the Gospel, yet through our own abuse of
so rich a mercy, and through the tyrannie of the Prelates,
we have been a long time spoiled of our Ministers (a yoke
to many of us heavier then death) who being chased into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, were not altogether un-usefull in the day of your
need; And we having been since oppressed and scattered,
as sheep who have no shepherd, now at last the wise and
righteous hand of the Lord, by the sword of the Rebels,
hath bereft us of our friends, and spoiled us of our goods, &amp;c.
left us but a few, and that a poor handfull of many, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hath chased from us the rest that were called our Ministers;
the greatest part whereof we could scarce esteem such as
being rather Officers to put the Prelats Injunctions in execution,
then feeders of our souls: So that now being visited
with sword and sicknesse, and under some apprehension
of famine, if withall we shall taste of the sorest of all
plagues, to be altogether deprived of the Ministery of the
Word, we shall become in so much a worse condition
then any Pagans, as that once we enjoyed a better: Neither
know we what hand to turn us to for help, but to the
Land so far obliged by the Lords late rare mercies, and so
far enriched to furnish help of that kinde; a Land whence
many of us drew our blood and breath and where (pardon
the necessary boldnesse) some of our own Ministers now are,
who were so violently plucked from us, so sore against both
their own and our wills; yea, the Land that so tenderly
in their bosoms received our poor out-casts, and that hath
already sent us so rich a supply of able and prosperous Souldiers
to revenge our wrong.

Therefore, although we know that your zeale and brotherly
affection would urge you to take notice without our
advertisement, yet give us leave in the bowels of our Lord
Jesus Christ, to intreat, if there be any consolation in Christ,
if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any
bowels of mercy, that now in this nick of time, when the
sword of the Enemie making way for a more profitable entertaining
the Gospel, having also banished the Prelates, and
their followers, when our extremity of distreste, and the
fair hopes of speedy settling of peace, hath opened so fair a
doore to the Gospel, you would take the cause of your younger
sister, that hath no brests, to your serious consideration,
and pity poore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Macedonians</span></span> crying to you that ye would come
over and help us, being the servants of the God of your Fathers,
and claiming interest with you in a common Covenant,
that according to the good hand of God upon us, ye
may send us Ministers for the house of our God. We do
not take upon us to prescribe to you the way or the number,
but in the view of all, the finger of the Lord points at these,
whom though persecution of the Prelats drew from us, yet
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our interest in them could not be taken away, wherein we
trust in regard of severall of them, called home by death,
your bounty will super-adde some able men of your own
that may help to lay the foundation of Gods house, according
to the Pattern. But for these so unjustly reft from us,
not only our necessity, but equity pleads, that either you
would send them all over, which were a Work to be parallelled
to the glories of the Primitive times, or at least that
ye would declare them transportable, that when Invitators
shall be sent to any of them, wherein they may discerne a
call from God, there may be no difficultie in their loosing
from thence, but they may come back to perfect what they
began, and may get praise and fame in the Land, where
they were put to shame. Neither are you to question your
power over us so to doe, or crave a president of your own
practise in that kind, for our extraordinary need calling on
you, furnisheth you with a power to make this a president
for the like cases hereafter: herein if you shall lay aside the
particular concernment of some few places, which you may
easily out of your rich Nurseries plant again, and make use
of your publike spirits, which are not spent, but increases
by your so many noble designes; you shall leave upon us and
our posteritie the stamp of an obligation that cannot be delete,
or that cannot be expressed; you should send to all the
neighbouring Churches a pattern, and erect for after-ages a
monument of self-denying tender zeale; you shall disburden
the Land of the many outcasts, who will follow over
their Ministers; and you shall make it appear, that the
churlish bounty of the Prelats, which at first cast some of
these men over to us, is not comparable with the cheerful liberalitie
of a rightly constitute General Assembly, to whom
we are perswaded, the Lord will give seed for the loane
which you bestow on the Lord; yea, the day may come,
when a General Assembly in this Land may returne to you
the first fruits of thanks, for the plants of your free gift.
And although you were scant of furniture of this kinde your
selves, or might apprehend more need then formerly, yet
doubtlesse, your bowels of compassion would make your
deep povertie even in a great tryal of affliction, abound to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the riches of your liberalitie. But now seeing you abound
in all things, and have formerly given so ample a proof of
your large bestowing on Churches abroad in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Germanie</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">France</span></span>, knowing that you are not wearied in well-doing,
we confidently promise to our selves in your name, that we
will abound in this grace also, following the example of
our Lord and the Primitive Churches, who alwayes sent
out Disciples in paires. But if herein our hopes shall faile
us, we shall not know whether to wish that we had died
with our Brethren by the Enemies hand; for we shall be as
if it were said unto us, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Goe serve other Gods</span></span>; Yet looking for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Assembly having received a Petition, subscribed by
a considerable number in the North of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, intimating
their deplorable condition, through want of the Ministerie
of the Gospel, occasioned by the tyrannie of the Prelats,
and the sword of the Rebels, and desiring some
Ministers, especially such as had been chased from them,
by the persecution of the Prelats, and some others to be added,
either to be sent presently over to reside amongst them,
or declared transportable, that upon invitation from them
they might goe and settle there; together with some particular
Petitions, desiring the returne of some particular Ministers,
who had laboured there before: All which the
Assembly hath taken to their serious consideration, being
most heartily willing to sympathize with every member of
Christs Body, although never so remote; much more with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Plantation there, which for the most part was a Branch
of the Lords Vine, planted in this Land. In which sollicitude,
as they would be loath to usurpe without their own
bounds or stretch themselves beyond their oun measure; so
they dare not be wanting, to the enlargement of Christs
Kingdome, where so loud a cry of so extreame neccesitie,
could not but stirre up the bowels of Christian compassion.
And although they conceive that the present unsettled
condition both of Church, and State, and Land, will
not suffer them as yet to loose any to make constant abode
there; yet they have resolved to send over some for the present
exigent till the next Gen. Assembly, by courses to stay
there four moneths allanerly: And therefore doe hereby
authorize and give Commission to the persons following, to
wit, M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Blair</span></span>, Minister at S.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrews</span></span>, and M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James
Hamilton</span></span>, Minister at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dumfreis</span></span> for the first four moneths:
M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Ramsay</span></span>, Minister at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>,
and M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Mac'elland</span></span>,
Minister at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kirkudbright</span></span>, for the next four moneths:
And to M. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Baillie</span></span>, Professor of Divinitie
in the Universitie of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>, and M.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Levistoun</span></span>, Minister of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stranaire</span></span>,
for the last four moneths: To repair into the North
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, and there to visit, comfort, instruct and encourage
the scattered flocks of Christ, to employ to their uttermost
with all faithfulnesse and singlenesse of heart, in planting
and watering, according to the direction of Jesus
Christ, and according to the doctrine and discipline of this
Church in all things, And if need be (with concurrence
of such of the Ministers of the Army as are there) to try and
ordain such as shall be found qualified for the Ministerie,
Giving charge unto the persons foresaid in the sight of God,
that in Doctrine, in Worship, in Discipline, and in their
dayly conversation, they studie to approve themselves as
the Ministers of Jesus Christ, and that they be comptable
to the General Assembly of this Kirk, in all things. And in
case if any of the above-mentioned Ministers be impeded by
sickness or otherwise necessarily detained from this service,
the Assembly ordaines the Commissioners residing at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>,
for the publike affairs of the Church, to nominate in
their place well qualified men, who hereby are authorized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to undertake the foresaid imployment, as if they had been
expressely nominate in the face of the Assembly. And this,
although possibly it shall not fully satisfie the large expectation
of the Brethren in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, yet the Assembly is confident
they will take in good part at this time, that which is judged
most convenient for their present condition, even a lent mite
out of their own, not very great plenty, to supply the present
necessity; requiring of them no other recompence, but
that they in all cheerefulnesse may embrace and make use of
salvation, and promising to enlarge their indebted bounty
at the next Assembly, as they shall finde the Worke of the
Lord there to require. In the meane while, wishing that
these who are sent, may come with the full blessing of the
Gospel and peace, and recommending them, their labours,
and these to whom they are sent, to the rich blessing of the
great Shepherd of the flock.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That whereas you were pleased the last Year to take notice
of our Petition, and conceived so favourable an act
in our behalf, from our hearts we blesse the Lord God of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our Fathers, who put such a thing as this in your heart to
begin in any sort to beautifie the House of the Lord amongst
us: Doubtlesse you have brought upon your selves the blessing
of them who consider the poor; the Lord will certainly
deliver you in the time of trouble. We trust no distance of
place, no length of time, no pressure of affiction, yea,
nor smiling of prosperity, shall delete out of our thankfull
memories the humble acknowledgement of your so motherly
care: in drawing out your breasts, yea, your souls
to satisfie the hungrie: although we have been beaten with
the sword, bitten with famine, our own wickednes correcting
us, our back-slidings reproving us, yet we have
not so farre forgotten the Lords ancient love, but that our
hearts were brought to a little reviving in the midst of our
bondage, by the Ministery of these, who at your direction
made a short visit amongst us. We know you did not conceive
it expedient at that time, to loose any for full settling
here, till the waters of the bloudy inundation were
somewhat abated, and prohability might be of some comfortable
abode, which we through the Lords revenging
hand, pursuing our enemies, and the vigilancie of your
victorious Army, is in a great measure attained unto. Whatsoever
might have detained some of these whom ye directed
to us, whose stay made our expectation prove abortive, we
shall ascribe it to our own abuse of such treasure, and want
of spirituall hunger, occasioned justly through the want of
food; And yet that same dis-appointment, together with
your faithfull promise of inlarging your indebted bountie,
which is put upon record in all our hearts, hath made us conceive
the seed of a lively expectation, that you will now no
more put your bountie, and the means of our life, into the
hazard of such frustrations, but will once for all, bestow an
ample and enduring blessing. And of this we are so much
the more confident, because our former suit was not denyed
but delayed: only we fear, if a new delay be procured,
till all things be fully settled, that the observing of winde
and clouds, shall hinder both sowing and reaping. And in
the mean time, the Prelates and their Faction may step in
and invest themselves of their old tyrannie over our consciences,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who if they once shall see us possessed of our own
Inheritance, those <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canaanites</span></span> dare not offer to thrust us out.
By all appearance, if the Jesuites had any hope to finde
welcome amongst us, they had provided us fully ere now
with their poysoned plants, Our hearts abhorre the checking
or suspecting of your proceedings, yet it is lawfull to
learn sometime from our enemie: But in this you have begun
before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year
ago, and thereby have ingaged your selves to perfect your
own beginnings, and bring us out of our orphan condition.
We are fallen in your lap, this ruine must be under your
hand; you cannot pretend want of bread or cloathing, you
must be healers: We have chosen you curators to your little
young sister that wants breasts; there is none in earth to take
her out of your hand, for we will not, nor cannot hide it
from your Honours and Wisedome, that we want bread,
and must not only, as before, have a bit for our present
need, but also seed to sow the Land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is therefore our humble and earnest desire, that you
would yet again look on our former Petition, and your own
obligatorie Act, and at least declare your consent, that a competent
number of our own Ministers may be loosed to settle
here, and break bread to the children that lye fainting at the
head of all streets, which although it may be accounted but
a restoring of what we lost, and you have found, yet we
shall esteem it as the most precious gift that earth can affoord.
When they are so loosed, if they finde not all things concurring
to clear Gods calling, it will be in their hand to forbear
and you have testified your bountie. But oh for the Lords
sake, do not kill our dying souls, by denying these our
necessar desires. There are about twelve or fourteen waste
congregations on this nearest coast: let us have at least a
competent number that may erect Christs throne of discipline,
and may help to bring in others, and then shall we
sing, that the people who were left of the sword, have found
grace in the wildernesse. We have sent these our brethren,

We the Commissioners appointed by both Houses of the

the rest of this reverend Committee, to represent to the reverend
the Generall Assembly of the Church of Scotland,
that we are commanded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To acknowledge with all thankfulnesse to God, their
zeal for purging and reforming Religion, and care not only
to prevent the grouth, but utterly to extirpate the Reliques
of Popery: And also the great blessing of Almighty
God upon their so constant and faithful endeavours, thus
far establishing them in truth and peace, together with their
labour of love, to procure the like happinesse to our Church
and Nation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To give them an account of their earnest desire and endeavour
to see the same Work promoted and perfected among
our selves; which though it hath been opposed and retarded
by the industrious malice of the Popish, Prelaticall, and
malignant partie, yet through Gods goodnesse it hath so far
prevailed, as to produce the removeall of the High Commission,
the making void the coercive power of the Prelates
and their Courts, The ejection of the Bishops from the
House of Peers, the turning out of many scandalous Ministers,
Besides that they have passed and presented to his
Majestie diverse Bills, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> For the suppressing of Innovations,
For the more strict observation of the Lords Day, against
Pluralities and non-residencie, For the punishment of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scandalous Clergie, For the abolition of Episcopacie, and
the calling an Assembly: The true Copies of which, we
herewithall deliver. Which Bills, through the underminning
of the Papists, Prelates, and their party (the
constant enemies of Reformation) have not yet obtained
his Majesties Royall assent. And yet considering the urgent
necessity of purging and settling the Church (as hath been
often pressed and presented to the Parliament of England,
by pious and frequent exhortations and Declarations from
that reverent Assembly) they have been constrained by an
Ordinance of both Houses, to call an Assembly of Divines,
and others, now fitting, to consider and prepare
what may conduce thereunto, which by the assistance of
some godly and learned Divines sent from this Nation (as
is earnestly desired) we hope may through the blessing of
God, bring it to perfection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet notwithstanding to let them know that by reason
of the prevailing of the Papists, Prelaticall Faction, and other
malignant enemies to this so much desired Reformation,
(all of them being now in arms against the Parliament)
these hopefull beginnings are likely, not onely to be rendred
ineffectuall, but all the former evils, superstitions, and
corruptions (which for the present, through the blessing
of God, are in a good measure removed) to be re-introduced
by strong hand which if once they should take root again
in the Church and Kingdome of England, will quickely
spread their venome &amp; infection into the neighbour Church
and Kingdome of Scotland the quarrell of the enemies of
this Work being not so much against the persons of men,
as the power of Godlinesse, and purity of Gods worship,
wheresoever it is professed. Both Houses do therefore desire
that reverent Assembly to lay seriously to heart the state
and condition of their sister Church and Kingdome, and
not only by their prayers to assist in these straits, but also by
such seasonable and effectuall means as to them shall seem
meet, to further and expedite the present aid and assistance
demanded by both Houses.

The Lords and Commons in Parliament acknowledging
with humble thankfulnesse to Almighty God,
the disposer of hearts, the Christian zeal and love
which the Generall Assembly of the Churches of Scotland,
have manifested in their pious endeavours for the preservation
of the true reformed Protestant Religion, from the
subtle practices and attempts of the Popish and Prelaticall
party, to the necessary Reformation of Church discipline
and Government in this Kingdome, and the more near union
of both Churches, do earnestly desire that reverend
Assembly to take notice, that the two Houses of Parliament
fully concurring with them in these pious Intentions; for
the better accomplishment thereof, have called an Assembly
of diverse godly and learned Divines, and others of this
Kingdome, unto the City of Westminster, who are now
sitting and consulting about these matters, And likewise
have nominated and appointed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> Earle of Ruthland, Sir

concerning the Peace and Common weal of both Kingdomes,
have received Directions to resort to the General Assembly
of the Church of Scotland, and propound and consult
with them, or any Commissioners deputed by them, in
all occasions which may further the so much desired Reformation
in Ecclesiastical matters in this Church and Kingdome,
and a nearer conjunction betwixt both Churches. In
performance whereof, Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stephen Marshal</span></span>, and Master
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philip Nye</span></span>, Ministers of Gods Word, and men of approved
faithfulnesse and abilities in their Function, both Members
of this Assembly of Divines here congregated, and
sitting, are appointed to assist and advise the same Committee
in such things as shall concerne this Church. And
the two Houses do hereby recommend the Commitees and
divines afore-mentioned, to the reverend Assembly of the
Church of Scotland, to be by them received with favour,
and credited in those things, which they, or any three, or
more of them shall propound to them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is likewise desired, that that reverend Assembly will
according to their former promise and resolution, send to
the Assembly here, such number of godly and learned Divines,
as in their wisedome they think most expedient for the
furtherance of this work, which so much concernes the honour
of God, the prosperity and peace of the two Churches
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>; and which must needs have a great
influence in procuring more safe and prosperous condition
to other reformed Churches abroad. And that their endeavours
may be more effectual, the two Houses do make this
request to them, with their authority, advice and exhortation,
so far as belongs to them, to stir up that Nation to
send some competent Forces in aid of this Parliament and
Kingdome, against the many Armies of the Popish and Prelatical
party, and their adherents, now in arms for the
ruine and destruction of the reformed Religion, and all the
Professours thereof. In all which they shall do that which
will be pleasing to God, whose cause it is, and likewise
safe and advantageous to their own Church and Kingdome,
who cannot securely enjoy the great blessings of Religion,
Peace, and Libertie in that Kingdome, if this Church and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The experience which we have had of your forwardnesse
in receiving, and faithfulnesse in weighing our
former addresses, hath given us abundant encouragement
to take hold upon this present opportunitie of breathing out
something of our sorrowes, which your love and our necessity,
command us to represent to your consideration and
compassion. Much we know we may commit to the wisedome
and fidelity of our Brethren these messengers, to impart
unto you concerning our miserable condition, and unto
them shall leave the most. Your own Nationall, but specially
Christian interest, will not permit you to hide your
eyes from the bleeding condition of your poor distressed
Brethren in England, should neither Letters, nor Messengers
be sent unto you; But Messengers coming, we should at once
neglect our selves, should we not thus a little ease our burdened
hearts, by pouring them out into your bosomes, and
seem ungrateful to you, of whose readinesse to suffer with
us, and do for us, we have had so great &amp; ample testimonies.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Surely if ever a poor Nation were upon the edge of a most
desperate precipice, if ever a poor Church were ready to be
swallowed up by Satan and his Instruments, we are that
Nation, we are that Church. And in both respects by so
much the more miserable, by how much, we expected not
a Preservation onely, but an augmentation also, of happinesse
in the one, and glory in the other. We looked for
Peace, but no good came, and for a time of healing, and
behold trouble! Our GOD who in his former Judgements
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was a moth &amp; rottenesse (and yet had of late begun to
send us health and cure) is now turned into a Lion to us:
and threatens to rend the very cawle of our hearts: From
above he hath sent a fire into our bones, and it prevails against
us; From our own bowels he hath called forth, and
strengthened an adversarie against us, a generation of brutish
hellish men, the rod of his anger, and the staff of his
indignation, under whose cruelties we bleed, and if present
mercy step not in, we die. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Righteous art thou, O
LORD, and just are all thy Judgements!</span></span> But O the more
then barbarous carriages of our enemies, where ever GOD
gives any of his hidden ones up into their hands, we need
not expresse it unto you, who knows the inveterate and
deadly malice of the Antichristian faction against the Members
of our Lord Jesus. And it is well we need not expresse
it unto you, for in truth we cannot. Your own thoughts
may tell you better then any words of ours, what the mercie
of Papists is, toward the Ministers and Servants of our
Lord Jesus Christ. But the Lord knows we are not troubled
so much with their rage against us, or our own miseries
and dangers; but that which breaks our hearts is, the
danger we behold the Protestant Religion, and all the Reformed
Churches in at this time, through that too great and
formidable strength the Popish Faction is now arrived at. If
our GOD will lay our bodies as the ground, and as the
street under their foot, and poure out our bloud as dust before
their fury, the wil of the Lord be done, might our bloud
be a sacrifice to ransome the rest of the Saints or Church of
Christ from Antichristian fury, we would offer it up upon this
service gladly. But we know their rage is insatiable, and will
not be quenched with our blouds, immortall, and will not
die with us, armed against us, nor as men, but as Christians,
but as Protestants, but as men desiring to reform our
selves, and to draw our selves and others yet nearer unto
God. And if God gave us up to be devoured by this rage,
it will take the more strength and courage (at least) to attempt
the like against all the Protestant and Reformed
Churches. In a deeper sense of this extream danger,
threating us and you, and all the Churches then we can expresse,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we have made this addresse unto you; in the bowels
of our Lord Jesus Christ, humbly imploring your most
fervent Prayers to the GOD that hears Prayers; who
(should we judge by providences) seems to be angry with
our Prayers (though we trust he doth but seem so, and
though he kill us, yet will we trust in him) Oh, give us
the brotherly aide of your re-inforced tears and payers,
that the blessings of truth and peace which our prayers alone
have not obtained, yours combined, may. And give us
reverend and much honoured in our Lord your advices,
what remains for us further to doe, for the making of our
own and the Kingdomes peace with GOD. We have lien
in the dust before him; we have poured our hearts in humiliation
to him, we have in sincerity, endeavoured to reform
our selves, and no lesse sincerely desired, studied, laboured
the publick Reformation, Neverthelesse the Lord hath
not yet turned himself from the fiercenesse of his anger.
And be pleased to advise us further, what may be the happiest
course for the uniting of the Protestant partie more firmly?
That we may all serve GOD with one consent, and stand
up against Antichrist as one man, that our GOD who now
hides himself from his people may return unto us, delight
in us scatter and subdue his and our enemies, and cause his
face to shine upon us. The Lord prosper you and preserve
us for that the great work of these latter ages may be finished
to his honour, and our own and the Churches happinesse
through Christ Jesus.

The Assembly considering how convenient it is, that all
the Ministers of the particular Kirks within this Kingdome,
in their administration, keep unity and uniformity
in the substance and right ordering of all the parts of the publick
worship of God, and that all the particular Kirks by
the same unity and uniformity, testifie their unanimous
consent against all schisme and division, unto which these times,
through the working of Satan and his instruments, against
the propagation of the Gospel of peace are so inclinable:
Doth ordain, that a Directorie for divine worship,
with all convenient diligence be framed and made ready in
all the parts thereof, against the next Generall Assembly,
to be held in the year 1644. And for this end that such as
shall be nominate by this Assembly, shall immediatly after
the rising of the Assembly, set themselves apart (so far as
may be) from their particular callings, and with all diligence
and speed, go about this so publick, so pious and so
profitable a work. And when they have brought their endeavours
and labours about this Directorie to an end, that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it be put into the hands of the Commissioners of the Generall
Assembly, to be revised, and thereafter by them sent in
severall Copies to all the particular Synods to be held in
April and May, that the famine being reported with their
observations, notes, and animadversions to the Generall
Assembly, it may in end, after their full triall and approbation,
by order and authority from them be received, and
practiced by all the Ministers and particular Kirks. And for
preserving of peace and brotherly unity, in the mean while,
till the Directorie by universall consent of the whole Kirk
be framed, finished, and concluded, The Assembly forbiddeth
under the pain of the censures of the Kirk, all disputation
by word or writing, in private or publick, about
different practices in such things, as have not been formerly
determined by this Kirk, And all condemning one of another
in such lawfull things as have been universally received,
and by perpetuall custome practised by the most faithfull
Ministers of the Gospell, and opposers of corruptions
in this Kirk, since the first beginning of Reformation to
these times. And doth exhort and command that all
endeavour to keep the unity of the spirit, in the bond
of peace, that all beginnings of Separation, all scandall and
division, be by all means avoided; And that against envying,
and strife, and faction, and glorying in men, every
one go before another in the duties of love, and so fulfill the
Law of Christ; That continuing in one spirit and one minde,
&amp; fighting together through the faith of the Gospel, we may
mutually aide, strengthen and comfort one another in all
Pastorall and Christian emploiments, better resist the common
adversaries, edifie one another in the knowledge and
fear of God, and the more acceptably, and with the greater
blessing serve the Lord who hath done so great things
for us.

We the Commissioners appointed by both Houses of the
Parliament of England, being commanded by them
(as we have already declared) to desire the reverend Assembly
of Scotland, seriously to lay to heart the present Estate
of their Sister Church and Kingdome of England, and not
onely to assist with their Prayers in their straits, but also by
such reasonable and effectuall means as to themselves shall
seem meet to further and expedite the assistance now desired
by both Houses from the Kingdome of Scotland, and a
more strict union with them, Have thought fit in Pursuance
of the commands received from both Houses of Parliament,
to communicate to this Assembly the paper which to this purpose
we have lately delivered to the Honourable Convention
of Estates, in this Kingdome, that so this reverend
Assembly might be the better enabled, to contribute their
best assistance toward the furthering and expediting of the
same. Wherein we assure our selves of their ready and willing
affections, considering the great service they may do
to God, and the great honour may redound to themselves
in becoming the Instruments of a glorious Reformation,
not onely through this Iland, but from thence possibly to be
spread to other Churches now oppressed under the Antichristian
bondage, and tyrannie of the Popish and prelatical
Faction. We will not say there lies any obligation upon
this Church and Kingdome, to comply with the desires of
the two Houses of Parliament; though we might call to
minde that God by the hand of the Church and Kingdome
of England, did once reach forth assistance and aid unto
this Nation, and hath since used them as a help to that blessed
Reformation it now enjoyes. And who knoweth
whether the wise providence of God hath not suffered this
Church and Kingdome to be tempted thereby, to make
them the more feasible of the present miseries of their brethren,
and likewise given them a good issue, with the tentation,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that they might be made a means of our deliverance?
We shall not need to offer any grounds of prudence
to invite them hereunto, who have already prevented us in
the acknowledgement of what might be said of that kinde
in the advice presented by the Commissioners of the General
Assembly. July 6. 1643. unto the Convention of Estates,
expressing as one remedie of the present dangers of this
Church and Kingdome, their earnest desire of renewing the
league and association with England, for the defence of
Religion against the common enemie, and of further extending
the same against Prelacie, and Popish Ceremonies,
for Uniformity in externall worship and Church-government.
And we hope that the same God who hath put
these desires into the hearts of both Kingdomes, will make
use of this present opportunity to knit them both to himself,
and each other in a most strict and durable Union,
and thereby the more firmly to establish truth and peace in
both Nations. Howsoever this which we have done in
discharge of our duty, will afford the comfort of a good
conscience in our greatest distresses, and give us ground to
expect deliverance some way or other from the manifold
wisedome and power of God, who though men and means
fail, will not cast off his people, nor forsake his inheritance.
We have onely this to adde further, that we are
commanded by both Houses to let this reverend Assembly
know that it is their earnest desire, that what other Propositions
may be thought fit to be added and concluded by this
Assembly, whereby the assistance and Union betwixt the
two Nations, may be made more beneficiall and effectuall
for the securing of Religion and Libertie, should be offered
to us, and taken to our speedy consideration,

August 12. to the Convention, and this day
to the Assembly</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We the Commissioners appointed by both Houses of the
Parliament of England, are by our instructions commanded
to put their brethren of Scotland in minde, that
the Popish and prelaticall Faction that began with them,
about the year 1638. and 1639. and then intended to make
way to the ruine of the Kingdome of England by theirs,
have not abated any part of their malice toward the Nation
and Church of Scotland, nor are at all departed from their
designe of corrupting and altering Religion through the
whole Iland, though they have inverted the manner of
their proceeding, conceiving now that they have an easier
way to destroy them, if they may first prevail over the Parliament
and Kingdome of England. In which respect it is
the desire of both Houses, that the two Nations may be
strictly united, for their mutuall defence against the Papists
and prelaticall Faction, and their adherents in both Kingdomes,
and not to lay down arms till those their implacable
enemies shall be dis-armed, and subjected to the authority
and justice of Parliament in both Kingdomes respectively.
And as an effectual mean hereunto, they desire their
brethren of Scotland to raise a considerable force of Horse
and Foot, for their aide and assistance, to be forthwith
sent against the Papists, prelatical Faction, and malignants
now in arms in the Kingdome of England.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And for the better encouragement of the Kingdome of
Scotland to this necessary and so much desired Union, we
are by both Houses of Parliament authorized to assure their
brethren, that if they shall be annoyed or endangered by any
Force or Army, either from England or any other place,
the Lords and Commons of England will assist them with a
proportionable strength of Horse and Foot, to what their
Brethren shall now affoord them to be sent into Scotland
for the defence of that Kingdome. And they will maintain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a guard of Ships at their own charge upon the coast of
Scotland for the securing of that Kingdome, from the invasion
of Irish Rebels or other enemies, during such time
as the Scotish Army shall be employed in the defence of the
Kingdome of England, And to the end that nothing might
be wanting in the Parliament and Kingdome of England to
facilitate this work (wherein the true reformed Religion,
not onely in these two Kingdomes, but throughout all Europe
is so highly concerned) We are farther authorized to
consider with their brethren the Estates and Kingdome of
Scotland, of what other Articles or propositions are fit to
be added and concluded, whereby this assistance and Union
betwixt the two Nations, may be made more beneficial
and effectual for the security of Religion and Libertie in
both Kingdomes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All which being taken into the serious and Christian consideration
of the right honourable the Lords and others of
the Convention of the Estates of Scotland, we hope there
will not need many arguments to perswade and excite them
to give their consent, and that with all convenient speed,
to these desires of both houses of the Parliament of England;
seeing now they have so fully declared, as by what
they have done already, so by what they are yet desirous to
do, that the true state of this cause and quarrel is Religion,
in the Reformation whereof they are, and have been so
forward and zealous, as that there is not any thing expressed
unto them by their brethren of Scotland, in their former or
latter Declarations, which they have not seriously taken
to heart, and seriously endeavoured to effect, (notwithstanding
the subtle malicious and industrious oppositions)
that so the two Kingdomes might be brought into a near
conjunction in one form of Church-government, one directorie
of worship, one Catechisme, &amp;c. and the foundation
laid of the utter extirpation of Popery and prelacie out
of both Kingdomes. The most ready and effectual means
whereunto, is now conceived to be, that both Nations enter
into a strict Union and league, according to the desires of
the two Houses of Parliament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And to induce the perswasion of this (if there were cause)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we might observe, that, in the many Declarations made by
the General Assembly or States of Scotland, to their Brethren
of England, there have been sundry expressions, manifesting
the great necessitie that both Kingdomes for the securitie
of their Religion and Liberties, should joyn in this
strict Union against the Papists, Prelats, and their adherents:
As also in the endeavour of a near conjunction between the
Churches of both Nations. The apprehension and foresight
of which, hath caused the Popish and Prelatical Faction in
forreigne parts as well as in his Majesties Dominions, strictly
and powerfully to combine themselves to the hinderance
of this so necessary Work, and the universal suppression of
the true protestant Religion in Europe: A course not much
different from that which they took in the year 1585. when
the wisedome and zeal of this Nation to counter-myne so
wicked a conspiracie, and from the due sense of the mutual
interest of these two Kingdomes in Religion and Libertie,
found a necessity of entring into a league of this nature, as
well considering, that thereby no lesse safetie might be expected
to both Nations, then danger by forbearing the same.
And though we doubt not but in so necessary and so good a
Work, many difficulties may arise to interrupt and retard the
same; yet we are as confident, that the heartie and brotherly
affection of this Nation to the Parliament and Kingdome
of England, will easily break through them; and the rather
because in the like cases of difficultie and danger, not only
at the time of the league above-mentioned, but before, and
likewise since, when any opportunity hath offered it self
particularly, during the sitting of this present Parliament, the
Kingdome of England hath been very forward and ready to
lay to heart the dangers of the Kingdome of Scotland as their
own, and to decline no means within the reach of their power
for the redresse or prevention of the same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We the Assembly of Divines and others, called and
now sitting by authority of both Houses of Parliament,
to be consulted by them in matters of Religion;
have received from the honourable Houses of Commons, a
speciall order (dated the 3. of this instant August) recommending
it to us to write a Letter to the Generall Assembly
of the Church of Scotland, taking notice of the pious and
good expeditions to this Church and State, certified in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
late Answer of the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly
of the Kirk of Scotland, from their meeting at Edinburgh
the 17. of July 1643. And further to desire them to possesse
the people of that Kingdome with our condition, and to
encourage them to our assistance in this cause of Religion.
And having with that order received and read the said Answer
directed to the honourable Houses of the Parliament of
England, we cannot sufficiently expresse the great content
and comfort, unto which it hath raised us in the midst of the
sad and calamitous condition under which we lie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is no small refreshing to our mourning spirits to finde,
that yet our God hath not left us wholly comfortlesse, nor
cast us so far out of his sight, as having made us sick with
smiting that should be verified of us, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lover and friend hast
thou put far from us</span></span>, and that no man should turn aside to ask
how we do: but that we finde so many of the Churches of

so far to take to heart our extremities, as to sit in the
dust with us, and so to look upon our adversities, as being
themselves also in the body.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as we cannot render thanks sufficient unto our God
for remembring such mercie in the midst of so much

of thankfull acknowledgement of the great
debt which your love doth continually lay upon, not us
alone, but upon this whole Kingdome, in the free and
full expressions of your care, piety and zeal, and of
like affections of that whole Nation, to assist and concurre
with the Parliament here, by all good and lawfull means,
for sending of Religion in godly unity and uniformitie
throughout all his Majesties Dominions, against all the
designes, power and malice of bloudie Papists, and
the Prelaticall Faction, with all their malignant adherents,
the common enemies of Reformation, truth and
peace.

their readinesse to give assistance for recovering and settling
the peace of this Kingdome, against the devices, power and
practices of the enemies of Religion, and the publick
Good, whereof some hints are given in that Answer and
of which we doubt not but the honourable Houses or Parliament
will be so sensible as to give such a return as becomes
them: for they, better knowing then we do, the depth
of the evils under which this Nation now groaneth, and the
further dangers imminent, will be more able to value and
improve the great affection and wisedome of their Brethren,
in points of so high and generall concernement, for the safetie
and glory of the Kings Majestie, and of all his Kingdomes,
and are more fit to take notice of advices of that

But as for the many prudent, pious, and reosonable admonitions

put such a thing as this into the hearts of our Parliament,
to cleanse the House of the Lord of all the uncleannesse
that is in it, by impure Doctrine, Worship, or Discipline.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor can we in the depth of all our sufferings and sorrows,
withhold our hearts from rejoycing in the wonderful goodnes
of God toward this Kingdome, in that he hath let us see
the gracious fruit of your effectuall prayers and teares, as
well as of our own endeavours this way: In bringing together
this Assembly, although in a very troublous time,
whereby we may have better opportunity more fully to
poure out our soules jointly and together to our GOD,
for healing of this now miserable Church and Nation:
To consider throughly, for what more especially the Land
mourneth, and how we may be most usefull to our great GOD
and Master JESUS CHRIST; In contributing
somewhat to the vindicating of his precious truth, many
wayes corrupted through the craft of men that have lyen in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wait to deceive: In the seeking out of a right way of worshipping
our GOD according to his own heart: In promoting
the power of Godlinesse: in the hearts and lives of
all his people, and in laying forth such a Discipline as may
be most agreeable to Gods holy Word, and most apt to procure
and preserve the peace of this Church at home, and
nearer agreement with the Church of Scotland (highly honoured
by us) and other the best reformed Churches abroad,
That so to the utmost of our power, we may exalt him that
is the only Lord over the Church, his own House, in all
his Offices, and present this Church as a chast virgin unto
Christ.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is a timely and savourie prayer which you have put up
at the throne of Grace, touching the due managing of the
proceedings in this Assembly, and that with straigth intentions
we may all seek the truth in every thing, which by the
blessing of God upon our labours, must needs produce all
those blessings which your worthie Commissioners mention.
And now, for your comfort as well as our own encouragement,
we desire you to take notice of the gracious
answer of the God that heareth prayer, unto your fervent
cryes. For beside our own particular addresses and secret
vows to our God to be faithful (with disdain of all baits of
avarice and ambition) it hath pleased the Divine Providence
so to direct both the honourable Houses of Parliament, to
take care of preventing all obliquitie in our proceedings,
and to stop the mouthes of all that watch for their and our
haltings, and are apt maliciously to traduce both, (as if
we were so restrained by them, in our votes and resolutions,
as to be bound up to the sense of others, and to carry
on private designes in a servile way) that the Houses have
tendered to us, and we have most readily taken a solemne
and serious Protestation in the presence of Almighty God,
to maintain nothing in this Assembly touching Doctrine,
but what we are perswaded in our consciences to be the
truth; nor in matters of Discipline, but what we conceive
to conduce most to the glory of God, and the good
and peace of his Church; which doth not only secure the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Members against fettering of their judgements or votes,
but engage them to the use of all freedome, becoming the
integrity of conscience, the weight of the Cause, the gravitie
and honour of such an Assembly. It is likewise a
great consolation, that our GOD hath put it into your
hearts to designe some godly and learned Brethren to put in
their sickles with us into this Harvest, which is so great,
and requires so many Labourers; for which, as we heartily
return thanks, so we earnestly pray the Lord to open a way
to their timely coming hitherto and do assure them of all testimonies
of respect, love, and the right hand of fellowship,
who shall under-take a journey so tedious, and now
so perillous, to joyne with us in the Work, when it shall
please the honourable Houses of Parliament to invite them
thereunto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remaines that we should now spread before you our calamities,
dangers and fears of further evils, not only drawing
toward us, but even threatning you also; and crave
your passionate aids in all wayes becoming the Servants of
Jesus Christ. But your Commissioners have so fully declared
your certain knowledge and deep sense of them, that
they have left us no room for inlarging ourselves in this
particular, to Brethren so full of bowels and zeal. And
they have sufficiently intimated unto the honourable Houses,
that you are well aware how often the common enemies
of both Kingdomes have consulted together with one
consent to cut off both the one and the other from being a
Nation, and that the Tabernacles of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edom</span></span>,

even in your Kingdome, happily rescued from
their former tyrannies, as well as in this of scorched England,
now in the furnace: Only they have varied the
Scene, pouring out all their fury upon us at the present:
That so, having once troden us under as mire in the streets,

Charming, &amp;c.</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The abundance and increase of the sin of Witch-craft,
in all the sorts and degrees of it in this time of Reformation,
is to be taken to heart by this reverend Assembly,
who would to that end consider.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. Of the occasions thereof, which are found to be these
especially, extremity of grief, malice, passion, and desire
of revenge, pinching povertie, solicitation of other
Witches and Charmers; for in such eases the devill assails
them, offers aide, and much prevails.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. Of the reasons and causes of Satans prevailing;
which are grosse ignorance, infidelitie, want of the love
of the truth (which GOD hath made so long and clearly to
shine in our Land) and profanesse of life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. Of the means and wayes to bring them to a confession
and censure, which we conceive to be, that a standing
Commission for a certain time be had from the Lords
of Secret Councel, or Justice Generall, to some understanding
Gentlemen and Magistrates within the bounds of
Presbyteries that shall crave it, giving them power to apprehend,
try, and execute justice against such personares
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
are guilty of Witch-craft within these Presbyteries; For
many Paroches want the concurrence of civill Magistrates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Of the grounds of apprehending them, Which
may be a reigning brute of Witch craft, backed with dilations
of confessing Witches, being confronted with them;
for it is found that the dilations of two or three confessing
Witches, hath ordinarily proved true: Also depositions
of honest persons, anent malefices committed,
or cures used by them, may be a ground of apprehending
them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. Being apprehended, there would be honest and discreet
persons appointed to watch them; for being left alone
they are in danger to be suborned and heardened by others,
or of destroying themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. Ministers would be careful at all times, especially
Morning and Evening, to deal with them, by Prayer and
Conference, whiles they are in prison or restraint.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. The means to prevent the grouth of this wickednesse,
are:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That Ministers be every way careful and painful in warning
people of the danger thereof, and of Satans temptations,
both privately and publickly, and to instruct them in
the knowledge of the Gospell, and grounds of Religion,
by plain cathechesing, to urge lively faith in Christ, which
faith Witches bestow otherwise; Also to presse holinesse of
life, and fervent prayes in private, and in Families, and
in publick, that they be not led into temptation; And to
use the censures of the Kirk against profane persons, such as
Cursers, Whoores, Drunkards, and such like, for over
such like, he gets great advantage. Finally, it is requisite
for preventing of this hainous sin, that people seek knowledge
studie to beleeve, walk in holinesse, and continue
constant and instant in prayer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And because Charming is a sort and degree of Witch-craft,
and too ordinary in the Land; It would be injoyned
to all Ministers to take particular notice of them, to
search them out, and such as consult with them, and that the
Elders carefully concurre in such search; And this Assembly
would think on an uniforme way of censuring these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Charmers, and such as employ them, or consult with them,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Assembly approves the articles and Overtures aforesaid, And
ordaines every Presbyterie to take to their further consideration
by what other wayes or means, the sins aforesaid of Witch craft,
Charming, and consulting with Witches, or Charmers, &amp;
such like wickednes, may be tried, restrained, and condignely
censured and punished ecclesiastically and civilly: And
to report their judgementt herein to the next Assembly.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The General Assembly having received a Petition subscribed
by a very great number in the North of Ireland,
intimating their deplorable condition through
want of the Ministery of the Gospel, occasioned by the tyrannie
of the Prelats, and the sword of the Rebels,
and desiring some Ministers, especially such as had been
chased from them by the persecution of the Prelats, and
some others to be added, either to be sent presently over
to reside among them, or declared transportable,
that upon invitation from them, they might go and
settle there: Together with a Letter from the Vicount of
Airds to that same effect. All which the Assembly hath
taken to their serious consideration, being most heartily
willing to sympathize with every Member of Christ his
body, although never so remote, much more with that
plantation there, which for the most part was a branch
of the Lord his vine, planted in this Land. In which
solicitude, as they would be loath to usurpe without
their own bounds, or stretch themselves beyond their
own measure, so they dare not be wanting to the inlargement
of Christs Kingdome, where so loud a cry of so extreme
necessity, could not but stir up the bowels of Christian
compassion. And although they conceive, that the
present unsettled condition both of Church and State in that
Land, will not suffer them (as yet) to loose any, to make
any constant abode there; yet they have resolved to send over
some for the present exigent, till the next general Assembly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

at Kirkmichell, and Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matthew Mackaill</span></span> minister
at Carmanoch, for the first three moneths, beginning upon
the 8. of September next. Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">George Hatchison</span></span> Minister
at Calmonell, and Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hugh Henderson</span></span> Minister at Darly,
for the next three moneths, beginning the 8. of December. Master
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William Adair</span></span> Minister at Air, and Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John
Weir</span></span> Minister at Dalserfe, for the third three moneths, beginning
the 8. of March, 1644. And Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James Hamilton</span></span>
Minister at Drumfreis, and Master <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John Macclellane</span></span> Minister
at Kirkubright for the last three montths, beginning
the 8. of June, the said year 1644. To repair unto the
North of Ireland, and there to visit, instruct, comfort, and
encourage the scattered flocks of Christ. To employ themselves
to their uttermost with all faithfulnesse and singlenesse
of heart in planting and watering, according to the
direction of Jesus Christ, and according to the Doctrine
and Discipline of this Kirk in all things. And if need be
(with the concurrence of such of the Ministers as are there)
to try and ordain such as shall be found qualified for the Ministery;
Giving charge unto the persons foresaids in the
sight of God, that in Doctrine, in Worship, in Discipline,
and in their daily conversation, they study to approve
themselves as the Ministers of Jesus Christ; And that
they be countable to the Gener. Ass. of this Kirk in all things.
And in case of any of the above-mentioned Ministers be impeded
by sicknes, or otherwayes necessarily detained from
this service; The Assembly ordains the Commissioners residing
at Edinb. for the publick affairs of the Kirk, to nominate
in their place well qualified men, who hereby are authorized
to underrake the forefaid imployment, as if they had been
expresly nominate in the face of the Assemb. And this although
possibly it shall not fully satisfie the large expectation of
their Brethren in Ireland: yet the Assembly is confident
they will take in good part at this time that which is judged
most convenient for the present condition, even a mite out
of their own, not very great plentie to supply the present
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessity: Requiring of them no other recompence, but that
they in all chearfulnesse may embrace and make use of the
Message of Salvation, and promising to inlargre their indebted
bountie at the next Assembly, as they shall finde the
Work of the Lord there to require, in the mean while
wishing that these who are sent, may come with the full

prescribed in the word of God for our direction, and not by
uncertain rumours, and ungrounded reports of such men
as have not the fear of God before their eyes. And do earnestly
pray to God Almighty, in whose hands are the hearts
of Kings, to incline Your Majesties heart to the counsels
of truth and peace, to direct Your Government for the
good of your People, the punishment of male-factours,
and praise of well-doers, that this fire of unnatural and unchristian
warre being extinguished, the People of God, Your
Majesties good Subjects may lead a quiet and peaceable life,
in all godlinesse and honestie.

Church of Scotland, to the Declaration of
the honourable Houses of the Parliament
of England.</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, having
received a Declaration from the honourable
Houses of the Parliament of England, by their Committees
and Commissioners now residing here; have thought
good to make knowne unto the Lords and Commons in
Parliament, that all the Members of this Assembly, and
others well-affected here, do with most thankful respects,
take special notice of the expressions which they have been
pleased to make in the afore-named Declaration, not only
concerning their approbation of the desires and endeavours
of the General Assembly of this Kirk, for the Reformation
of the Church of England, and the union of both
Churches in Religion and Church-government; but also
concerning the resolution of both Houses, fully to concurre
with them in these pious intentions. With the same
thankfulnesse and due reverence, they acknowledge the
high respects expressed towards them by both Houses, in
directing unto them their Committees and Commissioners,
assisted by two reverend Divines, and in desiring some of
the godly and learned of this Kirk to be sent unto the Assembly
sitting there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Assembly doth blesse the Lord, who hath not only
inspired the Houses of Parliament with desires and resolutions
of the Reformation of Religion, but hath advanced
by several steps and degrees that blessed Work; By which,
as they shall most approve themselves to the Reformed
Churches abroad, and to their Brethren of Scotland, so
shall they most powerfully draw even from Heaven the blessings
of prosperity and peace upon England. And as it is
the earnest wish of their Brethren here, that the true state
and ground of the present differences and controversies in
England may be more and more cleared to be concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Religion, and that both Houses may uncessantly prosecute
that good Work first and above all other matters, giving no
sleep to their eyes, nor slumber to their eye-lids, until
they finde out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the
mighty GOD of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacob</span></span>, whose favour alone can make their
mountain strong, and whose presence in his own ordinances
shall be their glory in the midst of them: So it is our confidence,
that the begun Reformation is of GOD, and not
of man, that it shall increase, and not decrease; and that he
to whom nothing is to hard, who can make mountaines,
valleyes, crooked things, straigth, and rough wayes,
smooth, shall lead along and make perfect this most wonderful
Work, which shall be remembred to his glory in the
Church throughout all generations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And lest through any defect upon the General Assemblies
part, the Work of Reformation (which hitherto to
the great grief of all the Godly hath moved so slowly) should
be any more retarded or interrupted, they have according
to the renewed desires of both Houses of Parliament, and
their own former promises, nominated and elected Master
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alexander Henderson</span></span>, Mr <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Douglas</span></span>,
Mr <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Samuel Rutherfoord</span></span>,
Mr <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Balzie</span></span>, Mr <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">George Gillespie</span></span>,
Ministers of Gods Word; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> Earle of Cassels,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">John</span></span> Lord Maitland,
and Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Archbald Jonhstuon</span></span> of Warritoun, ruling Elders,
all of them men much approved here; With Commission
and power to them, or any three of them, whereof
two shall be Ministers, to repair unto the Assembly of
Divines, and other of the Church of England, now sitting
at Westminster, to propound, consult, treat, and conclude
with them, and with any Committees deputed by the
Houses of Parliament; (if it shall seeme good to the honourable
Houses in their wisedome to depute any for that end)
in all such things as may conduce to the utter extirpation of
Popery, Prelacie, Heresie, Schisme, Superstition and Idolatrie,
And for the feeling of the so much desired Union
of this whole island in one forme of Church government,
one Confession of Faith, one common Catechisme, and
one Directorie for the Worship of GOD, according to
the Instructions which they have received, or shall receive
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly appointed
to meet at Edinburgh from time to time, with the Assemblies
power for that end. And as the Generall Assembly
doth most gladly and affectionatly receive and fully trust
the Committees and Divines sent hither, so do they hereby
commend the afore-named Commissioners, not only to the
like affection and trust of the Assembly there, but also to
the favour and protection of both Houses of Parliament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And for the further satisfaction and encouragement of
their Brethren of England, the whole Assembly in their own
name, and in name of all the particular Churches in this
Kingdome, whom they represent; Do hereby declare, that
from their zeal to the glory of GOD, and propagation of
the Gospell, from their affection to the happinesse of their
native King, and of the Kingdome of England, and from
the sense of their own interest in the common dangers of
Religion, Peace, and Libertie, They are most willing
and ready to be united and associated with their Brethren
in a nearer League and solemne Covenant for the maintenance
of the truly reformed Protestant Religion, against Popery
and Prelacie, and against all Popish and Prelatical corruptions,
in doctrine, discipline, worship, or Church-government,
and for the settling and holding fast of unity
and uniformity betwixt the Kirks of this Iland, and
with the best reformed Churches beyond sea. Which
Union and Covenant, shall with Gods assistance be seconded
by their cooperating with their Brethren in the use of the
best and most effectall meanes that may serve for so good
ends; For the more speedy effectuating whereof, to the
comfort and inlargement of their distressed Brethren (whose
hope deferred might make their hearts to faint) the whole
Assembly with great unanimity of judgement, and expressions
of much affection have approved (for their part) such
a draught and forme of a mutuall Leagu and Covenant betwixt
the Kingdomes, as was the result of the joint debates
and consultations of the Commissioners from both
Houses, assisted by the two reverend Divines, and of
the Committees deputed from the Convention of the Estates
of this Kingdome, and from the Genrall Assembly:
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Expecting and wishing the like approbation thereof by the
right honourable the Lords and Commons in Parliament,
and by the reverend Assembly there, That thereafter it may
be solemnely sworne and subscribed in both Kingdomes, as
the surest and straitest obligation to make both stand and fall
together in that cause of Religion and Libertie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the Estates of this Kingdome have often professed in
their former Declarations, the integritie of their Intentions
against the common enemies of Religion and Libertie in
both Kingdomes, and their great affection to their Brethren
of England, by reason of so many and so near relations:
So doubtlesse now in this time of need they will
not fail to give reall proof of what before they professed.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversitie.</span></span>
Neither shall the Assembly, or their Commissioners be wanting
in exhorting all others to their duty, or in concurring so
far as belongeth to their place and vocation, with the Estates
now conveened, in any lawful and possible course which
may most conduce to the good of Religion and Reformation,
the honour and happinesse of the Kings Majestie, the
deliverance of their Brethren of England from their present
calamitous condition, and to the perpetuating of a firme and
happy peace betwixt the Kingdomes.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the sufferings of Christ abound in you, So our heartie
desire to God is, that your consolations may much more
abound by Christ. The perusing of your Letter, produced
in every one of us such a mixture of affections, as were
at the laying of the foundation of the second Temple,
where there was heard both shouting for joy, and weeping
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
aloud; We rejoyced that Christ our Lord had at last in
that Land created a new thing, in calling together, not as
before of a Prelaticall Convocation to be task-masters over
the people of the Lord, but an Assembly of godly Divines,
minding the things of the Lord, whose hearts are set to
purge the defiled House of GOD in that Land: yet this
our joy was not a little allayed by the consideration of the
sad and deplorable condition of that Kingdome, where the
high provocations of so many years, the hellish plots of so
many enemies in a nick of time, have brought in an inundation
of over-flowing calamities: We know you are patiently
bearing the indignation of the Lord, because you have sinned
against him, till he throughly plead your cause, and
disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon, who now laugh among
themselves, while you are fed with the bread of
tears, and get tears to drink in great measure, being on the
mountains like the doves of the valleyes, all of you mourning
every one for his iniquitie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is now more nor evident to all the Kirks of Christ, with
what implacable fury and hellish rage, the bloud-thirstie
Papists, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babylon</span></span> without, and the Prelaticall Faction,
the children of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edom</span></span> within, having adjoyned to themselves
many malignant adherents, of time-serving Atheists,
haters of holinesse, rejecters of the yoke of Christ, (to
whom the morning light of Reformation is as the shadow of
death) have begun to swallow up the inheritance of the
Lord, and are not easily satisfied in making deep and long
furrowes on your backs. We cannot say that the loudnesse of
your cry surpasseth the heavinesse of your stroake; but
though <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Lord hath delivered the men, every one into his neigbours
hand, and into the hand of his King, and they have smitten the Land,
yet the rod of the wicked shall not not rest upon the lot of the righteous</span></span>:
This cloud shall speedily passe away, and a fair sun-shine
shall appear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for us, though your extreeme calamitie did not threaten
the ruine of our Religion, Peace, and Liberties, as
it doth most evidently, we would hate our selves, if we did
not finde our hearts within us melting with compassion over
you: You are engraven on the tables of our hearts to live and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
die with you: we could desire that our heads were waters,
and our eyes a fountain of tears, that we might weep day
and night for the slain of the daughter of the Lords people;
So calamitous a condition of any of the Kirks of Christ,
could not but be very grievous unto us; How much more
shall not we stoup and fall down in the dust to embrace our
dearest Brethren of England, to whom we are tied in to
near and tender relations. When we were but creeping
out of the deep darknesse and bondage of Popery, and were
almost crushed with the fury of Foreigne Invaders, joined
with intestine enemies, pretending the name and warrand
of authority, as now your oppressours do; Then did the
Lord by your Fathers send us seasonable assistance against
that intended and begun bondage both of soul and body:
The repayment of which debt, the Divine Providence
seemeth now to require at our hands. And whereas of late
through our security we had fallen into a wofull relapse, and
were compassed about with dreadfull dangers on all hands,
while we aymed at the recovery of our former puritie and
libertie: Then we wanted not the huge supply of your fervent
Prayers, and other brotherly assistance of that Nation,
while those who are now your malignant enemies, would
have swallowed us up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These strait bonds of your ancient and late love, do so
possesse our hearts, that when the motions of the Commissioners
of honourable House of Parliament, and your
Letters did challenge our advice and aid for defence of Religion,
and advancement of Reformation, our
desires for a more strict Union and Uniformitie in Religion
betwixt both the Nations, did break forth into a vehement
flame, in such sort, as when the draugt of a League and
Covenant betwixt both Kingdoms for defence of Religion,
&amp;c. was read in open audience, it was so unanimously
and heartily embraced, with such a torrent of most affectionate
expressions, as none but eye or ear witnesses can conceive
whereof the two reverend Divines sent from you to us
being then present, no doubt will give you an account. Neither
was it so onely with us, but also the honourable Convention
of Estates here, with the like harmony of affectionate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expressions, did entertain the same; So that we hope to be
reall and constant in prosecuting the contents of this Covenant.
When we in our straits fled to the Lord, and entred
in Covenant with him, he owned us and our Cause, rebuked
and dissipated our enemies, and hitherto hath helped us, and
blessed our entreprises with successe from heaven, notwithstanding
our great weaknesse and unworthinesse. We trust in
the Lord, that as once it was prophesied of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Israel</span></span> &amp; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judah</span></span>, So
shall Scotland &amp; England shall become one stick in the hand
of the Lord, they shall ask the way to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sion</span></span>, with their faces
thitherward, saying, Come, let us joyne our selves to the Lord
in a perpetual Covenant, that shall not be forgotten; And so
shall it come to passe, that the Lords Jerusalem in this Island,
shall be a cup of trembling, and a burthensome stone to all
their enemies roundabout. Though now it be the time of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacobs</span></span> trouble, the Lord will deliver him out of it. Reverend
and dear Brethren, we conceive your case, and of all the
Faithful in that Land to be no other then of a woman crying,
travelling in birth, and pained till she be delivered. The
great red Dragon, (under whose standard the sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Belial</span></span>
are fighting) is your Arch enemy, This cannot but be a
time of fear and sorrow; But when the male childe shall
be brought forth, the pain shall cease, and the sorrow shall
be forgotten. We are very confident in the Lord, that you
will be faithful to Jesus Christ, in the work committed to
you by him in all his ordinances, and taking neither foundation,
corner stone, nor any part of the rubbish of Babel to
build the City that is called, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Lord is there</span></span>: But measuring
all with the golden reed of the Sanctuary, you may more closely
be united to the best Reformed Kirks, in Doctrine,
Worship, and Government, that you may grow up in him in
all things which is the head, even Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now Reverend and dear Brethren, though we know
that you abound in all gifts and graces, the Spirit of Jesus
Christ being plentifully powred out upon you, yet according
to your desire and the motion made by the Commissioners of
the Honourable Houses of Parliament, to testifie our hearty
sympathie with you in the work of the Lord, We
have nominate and elected some Godly and learned of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this Church to repair to your Assembly. We doubt
nothing of your hearty embracing them in the Lord,
and their diligent concurrance with you in advancing that
great work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not onely the common danger we are under, but the conscience
of our duty to his suffering people, layeth bonds on
us frequently to present you, and that blessed Work of Reformation,
in your hands, to the throne of Grace, that
the GOD of all Grace, who will call you into his eternal
glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered and
a while may make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle
you.

is one of the good blessings bestowed upon our Kirk of
late, and a pleasant fruit of our free Assemblies, That a
way is opened for keeping communion with our sister Kirks
abroad, and correspondence with you our dear Brethren,
in whose joy and sorrow we have so near interest,
and whose cause and condition we desire to lay to heart as
our own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All your former Letters were most acceptable, and full of
refreshment unto us, being taken as the earnest of a more
full and constant fellowship, longed after and hoped for:
And this your last, although full of sadnesse and sorrow,
yet accounted of us all most worthy of our tenderst affection
and best respects, both for your cause who sent it, and for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these worthy witnesses which did attest it: Wherein as you
have given unto us no small evidence, not only of your
love, but also of trust and friendly respect, by choosing
to poure out your grieved souls in our bosome; so we shall
with, and Godwilling endeavour, that you may really
finde some measure of brotherly compassion in our receiving
thereof. For these your sad expressions of deep sorrow,
being as you have given us to conceive but a part of
your complaint, and a lamentation lesse then the causes
doth require, cannot but melt every heart, wherein there
is any the least warmnesse of the love of Christ and his Saints:
And what Childe of the Bridegrooms chamber, can hear the
voice of so many friends of the Bridegroom, lamenting for
the evils which have befallen Christs Bride in England, in
the very night before her expected espousals, and not sit
down and mourn with them except his heart be fallen asleep
and frozen within him? This pitiful condition of our
sister Church in England hes matter enough we confesse to
move, yea, to rend our bowels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we should weigh this your heavie grief in the scales of
common reason, we behoved either to stand aloof from
your plague as men astonished, or sink down in heavinesse
and be swallowed up of sorrow: but when we ponder your
sad condition in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, we finde that
nothing hath as yet befallen unto you, save that which
hath been the exercise of the Saints in former times,
who have been made to sit down for a while in the shadow
of death before the day of their deliverance. We
finde nothing but that which may be a fit Preparation
for a comfortable out-gate from all your troubles. What
if it was necessary in the wise dispensation of Almighty
GOD, that a People in great estimation for wisedome
and power, such as England, should be thus farre humbled,
as you declare, to the end that your deliverance
maybe seen hereafter to be of the Lord, and not of your
selves? What if the Lord would not draw back his hand
from the Wine-presse wherein you now lye, till he should
draw forth from you these pitiful expressions of your low estate,
and so provide himself witnesses against the day to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
come, that he may have the greater and purer glory in your
salvation, and your gloriation may be in the Lord alone!
Dear Brethren, comfort your selves in the Lord; this
sowing in tears, doth promise a reaping in joy, and who
knoweth how soon he will give to you who are mourners
in Zion, beauty for ashes, the oyle of joy for mourning,
the garment of praise for the spirit of heavinesse; That you
may be called the trees of righteousness, the planting of the
Lord, that he may be glorified.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Though weeping be in the evening of this begun Reformation
and purging of the Lords House among you,
yet in the morning when the discovered filthinesse and
sweepings of the Temple shall be orderly cast out, joy
shall come with thanksgiving and praise. Though a fire
be kindled in the Land, yet it is not to consume any of the
mettal, for the Lord is sitting down as a Refiner amongst
you, and especially to purifie the sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Levi</span></span>, that he may
have a more pure oblation of spiritual worship and service in
all his holy ordinances throughout all the Land, which is
no token of wrath, but of loving kindnesse towards you.
No wonder that Satan doth thus rage, as you relate, foreseeing
his casting out: No wonder he stirre up all the
children of disobedience, and kindle their natural malice
against the children of God with the inspiration of hellish
fury: No wonder the spirit of Antichrist be mad, when
the morsel half swallowed down, is like to be pulled
out of his throat, the fat morsel of the rich Revenues of
England: No wonder he be cruell against you the servants
of Christ, who are consuming him by the breath of the
Lords mouth.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You do well to expect no mercy, if Papists and Prelats
prevail over you, neither desire we to deceive our selves
with hopes to be free from what the power and malice can
do against us; for they will not do to us if they get the
upper-hand, as we have done, and must do, if God bring
them low again under us; as they were before; for we and
they are led by the contrary spirits of Christ, and Anti-Christ:
We have laboured, and must labour for their conversion,
but they (except in so far as God shall bridle them)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will not rest without our destruction; for their fury against
our persons is much more fierie then our zeal is fervent against
their abominations: Let them follow the spirit of
lying and murthering, we must take us to our refuge, and
joyne our selves with all that are sensible of
the danger of the reformed Religion in prayer and supplication.

foot, who did never forsake them that sought him. Go on

without fear of whatsoever dangers, to purge the
House of the Lord, to repair the breaches thereof, to set
up all his Ordinances in their full beautie and perfection, to
the uttermost of your power, according to the pattern of
the Word of GOD, and zeal of the best reformed Kirks;
And let these two Kingdomes be knit together as one man

Having the opportunity of the sitting of this Venerable
Assembly, we thought our selves obliged
to render some accompt of the state of our Affairs.
It hath pleased the Lord to exercise us
since our out-coming, with many straits and difficulties,
yet in the mids thereof he hath wonderfully upheld and
carried us through. The depth of his wisedome hath suspended
us for a time from any great action, to make us walk
humbly before him, and to keep us in a continual dependance
upon himself: And yet he hath by his own power
scattered before us the great Popish Army, and much diminished
the number thereof, so that they do not now appeare
against us in the Fields; That all may learne to trust in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
GOD, and not in Man. It was farre from our thoughts
and intentions to have come this length at that instant when
the course of Divine Providence pointed out our way unto
us, which led us on by some long and speedie marches
to joyne with my Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fairfax</span></span> and his Sonne their Forces.
The City of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">York</span></span>, wherein a swarme of obstinate
Papists have taken sanctuary, is blocked up; Now and
then God favoureth us with successe in some enterprises about
it, and wee look for more if the time be come which
he hath appointed for the deliverance of this People.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our Soules do abhorre the treacherous attempts of our
disnatured Countrey-men, that have endeavoured to
make their native Kingdome a seat of Warre, and our
bowels within us are moved to think upon the maine mischiefs,
if not timeously prevented, that may follow upon
the unatural Warres there; Like unto these under which
this Kingdome hath groaned for a long time. We have
found none more malicous and cruel against us than these
of our own Nation, and we measure those at home, by
these here; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cursed be their rage, for it is fierce, and their anger
for it is cruell.</span></span> The present danger calls upon all to lay
out of their hands what ever may hinder their haste, as one
Man to come together for saving the Vine-yeard that the
wilde Boares would lay waste, and taking the Foxes that
would destroy the Vines. You are, Right Reverend,
now set upon the highest Watch-tower, from whence
you may discover the dangers that threaten on all coasts,
and we need not put you in minde to give warning to the
Watch-men in their severall stations; To rouze up the
People from their too great security; To call them to
unfeigned Humiliation, and to stirre them up to wrestle
with GOD by prayer; that hee would preserve Truth
and Peace at home against the machinations of Malignants;
That hee would prepare the People here, and make them
more fit to embrace the intended Reformation; And
that hee would command these unnaturall and bloudy
Warres to cease, that Religion and Righteousnesse may
flourish through the three Dominions, Praying GOD to send
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon you the Spirit of truth, who may lead you in all truth.

acknowledgement of the one, and a serious representation
of the other: Our case is such, as neither can be expected
at our hands, being stricken with astonishment, and full
of the furie of the Lord. We are these indeed who have
seen affliction by the rod of his wrath: So that it were more
fit, we had a Cottage in the Wildernesse amongst the Owles
to mourn out our imbittered Spirits, then that by word or
writ we should compeere before any of his People: Although
you cannot be wearied in wel-doing, yet we shall up
way think it strange, if now you shall give over any more
care of us; Seeing the Lord hath testified against us, and
the Almighty hath afflicted us. Your judgement is with the
Lord, and your reward is with God, not onely for your
two years visiting and watering a barren vineyard, but also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for your zeale and care to have your Reformation spred amongst
other opprest and borne-down Churches, whereof
you have given an ample and famous testimony in sending
hither that blessed League and Covenant which wee much
desired and longed for, as by our Petitions to the Church
&amp; State of our Native Kingdome is knowne unto you; which
hath had a wished and gracious successe by the favour and
blessing of God, accompanying the pains of these to whom
the tendering thereof was intrusted by you. And we conceiving
a chief part of our miserie to consist in our want of
opportunitie to joyne our selves with the People of God in
the foresaid Leagues; Esteeming our selves rejected of God
and unfit to be joyned in any comfortable fellowship in the
Gospel with them, when the said League and Covenant
was presented to the Regiments; Wee made bold to lay
hold upon the opportunity (though aflicted abjects) and
cheerfully and unanimously joyned our selves thereunto:
That if wee peerish in our misery, wee may die a Covenanted
People: and, if our miserable life be prolonged, we
may finde shelter and refreshment under the shadow thereof
in our fierie trials, confidently expecting from the Lord by
our neerer conjunction with you than before, an accomplishment
of what is agreed into the Covenant, which ye bountifully
expressed before we were one with you, to your
never-dying-commendation. We are nothing shaken in our
minds with the odious aspersions of sedition, combination
against the King: and overthrow of Muncipal Laws, &amp;c.
(wherewith our Covenant is branded) nor with the threats
of these who should be comfortable to us in our troubles:
But are the more encouraged to beleeve that God shall raise
up the Tabernacle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">David</span></span> that is fallen, and repair the
breaches thereof: For since we Covenanted with God, and
united our selves together, our dying Spirits have revived,
and we sing like those who have come forth from their Graves,
for God hath had mercy on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacob</span></span>: In testimony whereof
he hath opened the bowels of the Churches of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holland</span></span>,
who were strangers to us, and yet dear Brethren, and tender
Sympathizers with our afflictions and sorrows, who,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when these who were left of the Sword were in danger to
dye by famine, did plentifully relieve us in our straits, not
onely by comfortable encouragements to walk humbly with
God, and wait for him who hides his face from the house of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jacob</span></span> for a season; but also by their rich supply in Victuals
and others necessar for our relief and comfort, which we
humbly desire our Lord to repay seven-fold in their bosome,
and become your Supplicants to joyne with us in a
grateful acknowledgement of their singular favours: And
upon the heels of these favours you have continued your unparalled
compassions in keeping your forces and enabling
them, together with the other Forces, for avenging the cruel
murders, and effusion of Christian blood in this Land, notwithstanding
of your owne multiplied difficulties. The Lord
hath begun to delight into us, and in a day of salvation hath
helped us (So happy are the people who are in Covenant
with God.) We are these (indeed) who may justly be burnt
up for our unfruitfulnesse in the dayes of our plenty, &amp; stubbornesse
in the dayes of our affliction, which has brought us
so low, that where we once enjoyed a blessed plenty, we
must now beg of the crumbs that fall from your Table:
We cannot dissemble, but so farre as we can discern our
owne hearts, we would preferre the joyful sound of the
Gospel to our much wished Peace and precious lives: But
it may be discerned, your Consultations of before have been
guided by the Spirit of the Lord; in that when wee twice
in our forward hasting desires begged the present loosing and
planting of some Ministers amongst us, you judged it more
convenient to supply us by turnes, as foreseeing that our
Captivity was likely to endure: Our hopes are so far revived,
that we trust to see the day when he shall take the Cup of
trembling out of our hands, and put it in the hands of them
that afflicted us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And therefore, if you account us fellow-partners of the
Purchased Inheritance, Yet again suffer our necessitie to
plead with you, that as it hath been by the Committee of
Bils already advised, that a competent number of Ministers
may be gifted to us by your Commission when they shall
set the Calling cleared, the same may be granted as a testimony
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of your confidence, and expectation of our delivery;
And in the meane time some others may be sent by turnes
to keep in the dying lives of above twenty foure desolate
Congregations, who are in danger to perish for want of
Vision: And although we do proteste, we count not our
selves worthy of such favours, yet as we have resolved to
dye with the cry of hope in our mouthes to the Lords
Throne; So in obedience of the use of the means by him appointed,
we stretch out our hearts and our hands to you for

to be a perfidious Band and unnaturall confederacy, to
bring this Kirk and Kingdome to confusion; and to be full
of blasphemies against the late solemne League and Covenant

Declare that the subscribers of this or the like Declaration

gives power to the Commissioners of this Assembly appointed

We received yours of the 17 and 20 of May, and were

therein, of your sense of our condition here, and of the
Lords dealing with yourselves there in your straits and difficulties:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
We rejoyce exceedingly to see you make such a
blessed use of the Lords delayes, for your further Humiliation
and Dependence upon him: That Sanctuary, your
Enemies, and the Enemies of your GOD hath taken,
shall not save them: You have found by experience in
your marches and maintenance, that events are not ordered
by the propositions of men, but by the Providence and purpose
of GOD. There is a time for every purpose under
Heaven, and the Cup of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Amorites</span></span> must be filled: Which
being now full of every abomination, yea of the blood of
the Saints, the cry whereof cannot but be heard in Heaven,
and answered on Earth, presageth no lesse to us, than that the
Lords time of his deliverance of his own, and destruction of
his Enemies draweth near.

We are not unsensible of your present estate, and by the
Lords grace shall be careful, both here and with our Congregations
at home, to make all take the same to heart. As
for our condition here remembred with such pious affection
by you, we doubt not but ye have heard what the Lord
hath done for us; these happy beginnings of the Lords
scattering our unnatural Enemies in the North, gives us confidence
of his assistance in the midst of difficulties against
these that assault us in the South: It is nothing with the
Lord to help whether with many, or with them that have no
power.

The security of this Nation indeed is great, it is our part
to blow the Trumpet to give warning to the People, and to
rouze them from that fearful condition which threatneth
so much desertion. And to this end we have injoyned a solemne
Fast, the causes whereof being more particularly considered
by our Commissioners here, will no question be sent
unto you, that if the Lord please, you may joyne with us
there in that Action.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was the earnest desire of our hearts to have come unto
you at this time, and to have brought with us the desireable
fruits of our weighty imployments and labours, to our
common rejoycing in the mids of so many troubles both
here and there: but our Lord in his wisedome hath not
judged it fitting, that this should be the time of our joyful
harvest, and of bringing our sheaves, to be matter of sacrifice
to himself, and of shouting to us. Both Nations as yet
do but go forth weeping and bearing their precious seed;
yet are we confident through JESUS CHRIST, that
as it is a seed time, if the Labourers (although other men
before us have laboured and we are entred into their labours)
prove faithful unto the end, the harvest shall come in due
time, and in great plenty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The common Directory for publick Worship in the Kirks
of the three Kingdomes is so begun (which we did make
known to the Commissioners of the General Assembly) that
we could not think upon any particular Directory for our
own Kirk, and yet is not so far perfected, that wee could
present any part thereof unto your view: for although wee
have exhibited unto the Grand Committee (which is composed
of some of the Members of both Houses, and of the
Assembly, with our selves) the materials of the publick
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prayers of the Kirk, the method of Preaching, and the
order of administration of both Sacraments, and have the
Catechisme in hand; yet are they not throughly examined
by the Committee, nor at all by the Assembly or Parliament,
which we cannot impute to any neglect or unwillingnesse,
but to the multiplicity and weight of their affairs,
by which they are sore pressed, and above their power.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Directory for Ordination of Ministers (which upon
the extreme exigence of this Kirk was much pressed by the
Parliament) is agreed upon by the Committee and Assembly,
and some dayes past is presented to both Houses, but
hath not yet passed their Vote. The Assembly hath been
long in debate about the Officers and Government of the
Kirk (concerning which, we offered the two Papers
which wee drew up, according to the practice of our own,
and other Reformed Kirks, and so neere as we could conceive,
to the minde of the General Assembly, and did
send to the Commissioners of the General Assembly) and
hath passed many votes about the one and the other, but
hath turned their thoughts to such ripenesse and perfection,
that they could think upon the publishing of them,
or presenting them to your sight, nor is it in their power to
do so, without warrant of Parliament. Your wisedome
will consider that they are not a General Assembly, but
some select Persons, called by Authority to give their advice
in matters of Religion, that they walk in a way which
hath not been troden by this Nation before this time, that
many things seeme new unto them, and cannot obtain
their assent, till they see them clearly warranted by the Word
of GOD; That matters of the Government of the Kirk
have been much controverted here, and the prejudices against
Presbyteriall Government are many and great; That
the two extremes of Prelacie and Independencie, which
latter is the general claime of all Sects and Sectaries, have
prevailed most in this Kirk, and no other thing known by the
multitude but the one or the other; That such as look toward
the Government of the Reformed Kirks, finde a
mighty party within and without opposing them; And that
Reformation and Uniformitie must therefore be a work to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
full of difficulty, that the hand of the most high GOD,
which is now begun to be streched out in this Land, must
bring it to passe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was also presented to the Assembly, a new Paraphrase
of the Psalmes in English Meeter, which was well
liked of, and commended by some of the Members of the
Assembly; But because we conceived that one Psalme Book
in all the three Kingdomes was a point of Uniformity much
to be desired, we took the boldnes (although we had no
such expresse and particular Commission) to oppose the
present allowing thereof, till the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> should be
acquainted with it; and therefore have we now sent an essay
thereof in some Psalmes. We have also sent another <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Specimen</span></span>,
in Print, done by some Ministers of the City. Your
wisedome has to consider, whether it be meet to examine
them by your Commissioners there, that their judgements
be sent up unto the Assembly here, both about the generall
of Uniformity in this point, and about the particular way
of effecting it, whether by either of these two, or by any other
Paraphrase, or by changing some expressions in the
Books now in use, which is aymed at by the first of these
two.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we cannot but admire the good hand of GOD in the
great things done here already, particularly; That the Covenant
(the foundation of the whole Work) is taken,
Prelacie and the whole train thereof, extirpated; The
Service-Book in many places forsaken, plain and powerful
preaching set up; Many Colledges in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cambridge</span></span> provided
with such Ministers, as are most zealous of the best Reformation;
Altars removed; The Communion in some places
given at the Table with sitting; The great Organs at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pauls</span></span> and of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peters</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westminster</span></span> taken down; Images and
many other Monuments of idolatry defaced and abolished;
The Chappel-royal at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Whitchal</span></span> purged and reformed; and
all by authority in a quiet manner at noon day, without tumult:
So have we from so notable experience, joyned
with the promises of the Word sufficient ground of confidence
that GOD will perfect this Work against all opposition,
and of encouragement for us all to be faithfull in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Work of God, which is carried on by his mighty Hand,
that no man can oppose it, but he must be seen fighting against
GOD, It is unto us no small matter of comfort,
that we have heard of no Minister of the Gospel (except
such as the Kirk hath rejected) joining with the Malignants
there, in their ungodly and unnaturall afflicting of that
Kingdome, while they are endeavouring the relief of the
afflicted in this Kingdome; and we pray and hope, that
they may carefully keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond
of peace, and walk worthy both of their holy calling, and
of the great Work, which the Lord is working by his own
weak servants in Kirk and Policy.

have time (as his Lordship can inform you) to tender by

your love, that no waters can quench it, and such the undertakings

therefore are inforced to spend more time in our inquiries,
and in seeking of GOD a right way for us, that at length we
may put into that high way, the way of holinesse, wherein
Wayfaring men, though fools, shall not erre: And we
will wait upon our GOD (before whom we have been this

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do thankfully acknowledge your respectfull remembrance
of us by your Letters at all occasions; and not
a little rejoyce to see that happie correspondence and Christian
communion so sweetly entertained amongst us, which
is so acceptable in the sight of the Lord, so pleasant and
profitable, especially when kept and entertained betwixt
Kirks and Kingdomes about affairs of highest and most publick
concernment and interest: We have nothing more in
our desires than to entertain that harmonious correspondence,
that Christian sympathie and compassion, that
sounding and resounding of bowels, which well beseemeth
Kirks and Nations, United by a solemn League &amp; sacred Covenant,
for mutuall endeavours, by all lawfull means to a
further unitie in that Faith once delivered to the Saints,
and greater Uniformitie in Divine Worship, Discipline,
and Government, according to the Paterne.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The case and condition of your bleeding Kingdome
is no lesse sensible to us, than if our selves were in affliction
with you; but we trust all is working to your best,
and to our Lords glory: That some of you hes fallen, it
is to try you, purge you, and make you white: If
the Lord by those means be with that Reformation of
his Ordinances, bringing also alongst that other Reformation
of hearts and lives should it not be welcomed
with all joy, although it bee upon the expence of blood
and lives? The Lord will turn the bygone rage of Man to
his glory and your spiritual good the remnant of rage will
hee restraine. The Lord delivereth his owne by degrees,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he is with them in trouble, and delivereth them, and honoureth
them</span></span>; He who hath been sensibly with you hitherto,
and upholden you in your trouble, will we trust, yet deliver
you, and honour you: The more ye sow in tears, the
greater shall be your harvest of peace and joy, when the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lord according to the dayes wherein he hath afflicted you,
and the years wherein yee have seen evill, shall make you
glad, and his Work to appeare unto you, and his glory
unto your children, and the beautie of the Lord your God
to be upon you, and shall establish the work of your hands;
yea, even establish the work of your hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We should prove both unthankfull to God, and unfaithfull
to men, did wee not hold out unto you the Lords gracious
and powerfull dealing with us in the like condition,
and comfort you with the consolations wherewith wee our
selves have been comforted: We were involved in the like
difficulties; we had the strong opposition of highest Authoritie
set over two powerfull Kingdoms, beside this of ours;
and the unhappy providence of our wickedly wise and wary
Prelates, had done what in them lay, to make the Ministery
of this Land sworn Enemies to the intended Reformation:
So that we walked in a very wildernesse, in a labyrinth,
and as upon deep waters, wherein not onely did our
feet lose footing, but also our eyes all discovering or discerning
of any ground; yea; wee were ready to lose our
selves: Yet the Lord hath graciously rid us, and recovered
us out of all these difficulties, and set our feet upon a rock,
and ordered our goings. The experience wee have had in
our own persons, affoordeth us confidence and hope concerning
your affaires; and wee trust this hope shall not be
disappointed; it is our duety to hope upon experience, and
it is the Lords word and promise, that such an hope shall
not be ashamed. It cannot choose but beget confidence
in you, when ye shall consider, that ye have seen before your
eyes your neighboring Ship of this Kirk and Kingdome,
having (as it were) loosed from your side, in the like or
self-same storme, notwithstanding all tossing of windes and
waves, yet (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of the
Lord of hosts</span></span>) to have arrived safe and sound to the Port and
Harberie; yea, and to have dared to put out again unto the
storm, to contribute her weak endeavours for your help.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We acknowledge your impediments to be great and many,
the sufferings of your Brethren, the People of GOD,
cannot choose but both damp your spirits, and divide your
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thoughts: Your walking in an untroden and unknown way,
must put you (though never so willing to go on speedily,
yet) to take time and leisure to ask for the right way, and
ye want nor the opposition of some amongst your selves, to
whom notwithstanding we trust the Lord will reveale his
truth in his own time. Never the lesse (much honoured
and dear Brethren) go on couragiously against the stream of
all opposition; every Mountain in the way of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zerubbabel</span></span>,
the Lord shall make plain; and as many of you as are perfect,
be thus minded, that forgetting the things that are
behinde, and looking to the things that are before, you
presse hard towards the mark, as having before you, not
onely the prize of the high calling and recompence of reward,
but also at the end of this race, these two precious
Pearls and inestimable Jewels of Truth and Unity, and all
the Reformed Churches beholding and looking on, not
onely as witnesses, but also being ready to congratulate
and embrace you.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were greatly refreshed to hear by Letters from our
Commissioners there with you, and by a more particular
relation from the Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Waristoun</span></span> now with us, of your
praise-worthy proceedings, and of the great good things the
Lord hath wrought among you and for you: Shall it seem a
small thing in our eyes, that the Covenant (the foundation
of the whole Work) is taken? That that Antichristian Prelacy
with all the traine thereof is extirpate? That the door
of a right entrie unto faithful Shepherds is opened; many
corruptions, as Altars, Images, and other Monuments
of Idolarry and Superstition removed, defaced and abolished;
the Service-book in many places forsaken, and plaine
and powerfull preaching set up; the great Organs at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pauls</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peters</span></span> taken down; That the Royal Chappell is purged
and reformed, Sacraments sincerely administrate, and according
to the paterne in the Mount, That your Colledges,
the Seminaries of your Kirk, are planted with able and sincere
Professors? That the good hand of GOD hath called
and kept together so many pious, grave, and learned Divines
for so long a time, and disposed their hearts to search
his Truth by their frequent Humiliations, continuall Prayers,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and learned and peaceable debates? Should not all and
each one of these stir up our souls to blesse the Lord, and
render both you and us confident, that he who hath begun
the good Work, will perfect it, and put the Copestone upon
it; That the beauty of a perfected Worke may shine to all
Nations, and we may say and shout, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grace, Grace, unto
it</span></span>; That the time may be when full liberty and leasure
shall be to all the Builders of the House of GOD, to
give themselves with both their hands to the building up
and edifying the People of GOD in these things that belong
to life and Godlinesse, to the making of them wise to
salvation, and throughly furnished to every good work,
and when the Lord shall delight to dwell more familiarly,
and to work more powerfully in, and by his throughly purified
Ordinances? That you afflicted and tossed with
tempests and not comforted, shall have your stones laid
with fair Colours, your foundation with Saphires, your
Children shall be taught of GOD, and shall have great
peace, and no Weapon framed against you shall prosper, and
every tongue that riseth against you in Judgement shall bee
condemned; That the Lord will awake as in the ancient
dayes, as in the generation of old; That the Redeemed of
the Lord shall come unto Zion with singing, and sorrow and
mourning shall flee away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as we are confident that the Lord who heareth Prayer,
and hath promised to guide his Servants in all truth, will
bring your labours to a comfortable Conclusion: So do
all the Reformed Kirks, and the Kirk of Scotland above
all others extreamly long for the taste of the fruits of their
pious labours and continual pains: And so much the more,
that we have suspended some material determinations amongst
our selves, upon expectation of Uniformity; And
that in the meane time so many scandalous Papers come to
our view, and to the hands of the People here, for libertie
of Conscience, toleration of Sects, and such Practices as
are contrary to the Doctrine, Goverment, and Peace of
all the Reformed Kirks. For stopping and suppressing
whereof, as wee doubt not, but your wisedome, and the
Authority of the honourable Houses of Parliament will use
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some more effectual means; So do we hope that your Determinations
shall carry such evidence of Divine Truth, and
demonstration of the Spirit, that those unhappy Clouds of
darknesse shall be so scattered, that they shall be no more
gathered nor appear hereafter, to the dishonour of God,
the prejudice of his Truth, and the scandalizing of so many
Souls for which Christ hath dyed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do with hearty thankfulnesse resent all the kindnesse
and respect you have shown to our Commissioners, and your
high esteeme of them in love for the Works sake; Although
their presence here would be very comfortable unto us,
very steedable to the publick, and necessar in respect of
their great and important particular charges and Stations;
yet do we willingly dispense with all, yea nothing shall be
too dear unto us, so that this Work be finished with joy,
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem made the glory and praise of the whole Earth: Because
of the house of the Lord our God we will feel her good: For our Brethren

We have not been a little refreshed with your Letters sent
unto us and the Commissioners of the preceeding Assembly,

by all which and more particularly by a full Relation from
the Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Waristoun</span></span> a faithfull witnesse and a fellow labourer
with you there, we see and acknowledge that by the Lords
blessing, the Progresse of the Work is already more, than
we can overtake in the course of our thankfulness; that
your labours are very great, your pains uncessant, your
thoughts of heart many, that ye endure the heat of the

wel-doing, and that your labours shall not be in vaine in the
Lord, wee have renewed your Commission, and returned
the Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Waristoun</span></span> unto you, according to your desire,

When the Ordination and entry of Ministers shall be
conformable to the Ordinance of God, there is to be expected
a richer blessing shall be powred out from above, both
of furniture and assistance upon themselves, and of successe
upon their labours; for which end as our earnest desire is,
that the Directory for it may be established: so doe we exceedingly
long to see the common Directory for worship perfected,
which may prove an happy meane of that wished
for Uniformity in the Kirks of the three Kingdomes, shall
(we trust) direct by all Rocks of offence and occasions of
stumbling, and shall remove all these corruptions wherewith
the Lords sacrifice and service hath been defiled.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we are not without the knowledge, so are we
not without the feeling of the distresses of our
Native Countrey, and of the troubles of our
dear Brethren, specially that the hand of the
Lord is stretched out against you, not only by Invasion
from without of the basest of the children of men, but also
by the unnatural treachery of some within; who have dealt
perfidiously in the Covenant and Cause of God: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They hisse
and gnash the teeth; they say, Wee have swallowed her up: certainly
this is the day that wee looked for: Wee have found, wee
have seen it; the Lord hath caused thine Enemy to rejoice over
thee, he hath set up the horn of thine Adversaries:</span></span> Yet (saith
the Lord, who is thy Maker and thy Husband, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Lord of
hosts is his name, and thy Redeemer the holy One of Israel) for a
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
small moment have I forsaken thee, but with great mercies will I
gather thee. In a little wrath I hide my face from thee, for a
moment; but with everlasting kindnesse will I have mercy on thee:
For this is as the waters of Noah, the Covenant of my peace shall
not be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</span></span> When
the foundation of the House of the Lord was laid, the
Priests and Levites sung together in praising and giving thanks
to the Lord; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
ever,</span></span> And we hope at this time upon the coming of our reverend
Brethren, and the sight of that which they bring
with them, the noise of the shout of joy; shall be louder
then the noise of the weeping of the People. This we may
say, that not many years ago many of us would have been
content to have losed our lives, that we might have obtained
that which the Lord, if not in a miraculous, yet in a marvellous
and merciful providence, hath brought to passe in this
Iland, in these dayes, which many before us, have desired to
see, &amp; have not seen. God forbid that it should seeme a small
thing in your eyes which is done here already, as it is expressed
in a Paper from the Parliament, and Letters from
the Assembly. Ye are best acquainted with the tentations
and difficulties which ye meet with there, which are also
very sensible unto us; And when we consider how the
Lord hath carried on his work here at the first taking of the
Covenant, and since, against much learning and contradiction,
against much Policie, power, and all sorts of opposition
(such as Reformation useth to encounter) we are
ravished with admiration of the right hand of the Almighty.
For our part, we may confidently avouch in the sight of
GOD and before you, whom next unto GOD we do
respect and reverence, and to whom as your servants we
are accomptable, that in all our proceedings we had first
of all the word of GOD before our eyes for the Rule; and
for our Patern the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, so much as was possible;
and no lesse (if not more) then if all this time since
we parted from you, we had been sitting in a National Assembly
there, and debating matters with our Brethren at
home: Where we were not able to get every thing framed
to our minde, we have endeavoured as much as we could,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to preserve our own Reformation and practice, of which
our Brethren will give you accompt in the particulars, we
hope, to your satisfaction. That an Uniformitie in every
thing is not obtained in the beginning, let it not seem
strange; The levelling of the high Mountain of Prelacie,
The laying aside of the Book of Common Prayer, The Directory
of Worship concluded in both Houses of Parliament,
and the principall Propositions of Church-government passed
in the Assembly, all of them according to the solemne
League and Covenant, the greatest of all, are three or foure
witnesses to prove, that the Lord hath done great things for
us, whereof we are glad, and which make us <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">like them that
dream</span></span>: And we are sure, that not onely the Reformed
Kirks, but the Papists will say, The Lord hath done great
things for them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All that we desire, is: 1. That the Directory of Worship
may be returned by our Brethren with all possible expedition,
that it may be published here, and put in practise,
as that which is extreamely longed for by the good People,
and will be a remedy of the many differences and divisions about
the Worship of God in this Kingdome, esspecially in
this place: If there be any thing in it that displeaseth, let it
be remonstrate upon irrefragable and convincing reason, otherwise
ye will in your wisedome give approbation to it.
2. If there be any particular differences among some Brethren;
which are not determined, but passed over in silence
in the Directory, and yet hinted at in the Letter from
the Assembly, we hope that in your wisedome ye will so
consider of them, that they may be layde aside in due time,
and that in the mean while, till the Directory be concluded
and put in practice, there be no trouble about them, for
that were as Snow in Summer, and as Rain in Harvest. We
know nothing of that kinde, that all of us who love Unitie,
Order, and Edification, may not perfectly agree in, without
scandall or disturbance: And we beseech the Lord to
keep that Kirk free of such Sects and Monsters of opinions,
as are daily set on foot and multiplied in this Kingdome,
through the want of that Church-government by Assemblies,
which hath preserved us, and we hope, through the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
blessing of God, shall cure them. 3. Because Nationall
Assemblies cannot frequently conveene, we humbly desire,
that such a Commission may be settled as we may at all occasions
till the Work be finished, have our recourse unto, for
our direction and resolution: for we know both our own
weaknesse: and the greatnesse of the Work: wherein we
can promise no more but to be faithfull in obeying your
commandments, as in the sight of God, whom with our
Souls we pray, to grant you his Spirit, to guide you into
all truth, And thus continue.

We have not advised any imposition which might make it
unlawfull to vary from it in any thing; Yet we hope, all
our Reverend Brethren in this Kingdom, and in yours also,
will so far value and reverence that which upon so long debate
and serious deliberation hath been agreed upon in this
Assembly (when it shall also passe with you, and be settled
as the common publick Directory for all the Churches in
the three Kingdomes) that it shall not be the lesse regarded
and observed. And albeit we have not expressed in the Directory
every minute particular, which is or might be either
laid aside or retained among us, as comely and usefull in
practice; yet we trust—that none will be so tenacious of
old customs not expressely forbidden, or so averse from
good examples although new, in matters of lesser consequence,
as to insist upon their liberty of retaining the one,
or refusing the other, because not specified in the Directory;
but be studious to please others rather then themselves.

We have likewise spent divers moneths in the search of
the Scriptures, to finde out the minde of Christ concerning
a Forme of Church-government, wherein we could not

herein, wee have with all respect considered the severall

Papers of your Honourable and Reverend Commissioners,
touching this Head; and do with all thankfulnesse, acknowledge
their great zeal, judgement, and wisdom expressed
therein (as also, the excellent assistance and great furtherance
of your Reverend Commissioners in this great
Work; which now, through GODS goodnesse, is very
near to a period also).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In pursuit whereof, we made a strict survey and scrutinie
of every Proposition, that we might finde it agreeable to,
and warranted by the Word of God, in a method of our
own; without resting upon any particular modell or frame
whatsoever already constituted: What we have performed,
and how farre we have proceeded therein, we leave to the
information of your Reverend Commissioners, who have
been eye and ear witnesses of all that hath past, and we
doubt not but you will shortly receive a satisfactory answer
from hence, so soon as it shall be passed in the Honourable

And now, Right Honourable, and right Reverend
Brethren, let it not seem grievous that we have this long delayed
the satisfying of your earnest and just expectation: It is the
Lot of Jerusalem, to have her Wals built in troublous
times, when there are many adversaries. Nor let it
offend, that (albeit we acknowledge the many, great,
and inestimable expressions of your love zeal, and helpfulnesse
unto us every way in the day of our distresse, to be
beyond all that we can in words acknowledge) we professe
plainly to you, That we do most unwillingly part with
those our Reverend and dear Fellow-labourers, your
Commissioners, whom now you have called home, to
render an account of their imployment here; which hath
been so managed both by them and the rest of their Honourable

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whereas an happy Unity and Uniformity in Religion amongst
the Kirks of Christ in these three Kingdoms;
united under one Soveraigne, hath been long and earnestly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wished for by the godly and well-affected amongst us, was
propounded as a main Article of the large Treaty, without
which Band and Bulwark no safe well-grounded and
lasting Peace could be expected; And afterward with
greater strength and maturity, revived in the Solemne League
and Covenant of the three Kingdomes; whereby they
stand straitly obliged to endeavour the neerest Uniformity
in one forme of Church-government, Directory of Worship,
Confession of Faith, and forme of Catechising:
Which hath also before and since our entring into that Covenant,
been the matter of many Supplications and Remonstrances
and sending Commissioners to the Kings Majestie,
of Declarations to the Honourable Houses of the Parliament
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and of Letters to the Reverend Assembly
of Divines, and others of the Ministerie of the Kirk
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, being also the end of our sending Commissioners,
as was desired from this Kirk, with Commission to
treat of Uniformitie in the foure particulars afore-mentioned,
with such Committees as should be appointed by
both Houses of the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and by the Assembly
of Divines sitting at Westminster: And beside
all this, it being in point of conscience the chief motive and
end of our adventuring upon manifold and great hazards,
for quenching the devouring flame of the present unnaturall
and bloody Warre in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, though to the weakning of
this Kingdome within it self, and the advantage of the Enemy
which hath invaded it, accounting nothing too dear
to us, so that this our joy be fulfilled. And now this
great Work being so far advanced, that a Directory for the
publick Worship of GOD in all the three Kingdomes,
being agreed upon by the Honourable Houses of the Parliament
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, after consultation with the Divines of
both Kingdomes there assembled, and sent to us for our
Approbation, that being also agreed upon by this Kirk and
Kingdome of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, it may be in the name of both
Kingdomes presented to the King, for his Royal consent
and Ratification. The General Assembly having most seriously
considered, revised, and examined the Directory afore
mentioned, after several publick readings of it, after much
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
deliberation, both publickly, and in private Committees,
after full liberty given to all to object against it, and earnest,
invitations of all who have any scruples about it to make
known the same; that they might be satisfied, Do unanimously,
and without a contrary Voice, Agree to, and
Approve the following directory, in all the Heads thereof,
together with the Preface set before it: And doth
require, decerne, and ordain, That according to the plain
tenour and meaning thereof, and the intent of the Preface,
it be carefully and uniformly observed and practised by all
the Ministers and others within this Kingdome, whom it
doth concerne; which practice shall be begun, upon Intimation
given to the several Presbyteries, from the Commissioners
of this General Assembly, who shall also take special
care for the timeous Printing of this Directory, that a
printed Copy of it, be provided and kept for the use of
every Kirk in this Kingdome; Also that each Presbyterie
have a printed Copy thereof for their use, and take special
notice of the Observation or neglect thereof in every Congregation
within their bounds, and make known the same
to the Provincial or General Assembly, as there shall be
cause. Provided alwayes, that the Clause in the Directory,
of the Administration of the Lords Supper, which
mentioneth the communicants sitting about the Table, or
at it, be not interpreted, as if in the judgement of this
Kirk, it were indifferent and free for any of the Communicants,
nor to come to, and receive at the Table; or as if
we did approve the distributing of the Elements by the Minister
to each Communicant, and not by the Communicants
among themselves. It is also provided, That this
shall be no prejudice to the order and practice of this Kirk,
in such particulars as are appointed by the Books of Discipline,
and Acts of General Assemblies, and are not otherwise
ordered and appointed in the Directory,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, the Assembly doth with much joy and thankfulnes
acknowledge the rich blessing and invaluable mercy of
God, in bringing the so much wished for uniformity in
Religion, to such a happy Period, that these Kingdoms
once at so great distance in the form of Worship, are now
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the blessing of GOD brought to a neerer Uniformity
than any other Reformed Kirks, which is unto us the return
of our Prayers, and a lightning of our Eyes, and reviving
of our hearts, in the midst of our many sorrows and
sufferings, a taking away in a great measure, the reproach
of the People of GOD, to the stopping of the mouthes of
Malignant and dis-affected persons, and an opening
unto us a door of hope, that GOD hath yet thoughts of
Peace towards us, and not of evil, to give us an expected
end: In the expectation and confidence whereof we do
rejoyce, beseeching the Lord to preserve these Kingdomes
from Heresies, Schismes, Offences, Prophanesse, and
whatsoever is contrary to sound Doctrine, and the power
of Godlinesse, and to continue with us and the generations
following, these his pure and purged Ordinances, together
with an increase of the power and life thereof, To the glory
of his great Name, the enlargement of the Kingdom of
his Son, the corroboration of Peace and Love between the
Kingdoms, the unity and content of all his People, and
our edifying one another in love.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. That every Grammar School be visited twice in the
year by Visitors, to be appointed by the Presbyterie
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Kirk-Session in Landward Parishes, and by the
Town-Councel in Burghs, with their Ministers; and
where Universities are, by the Universities, with consent
alwayes of the Patrons of the School, that both the fidelitie
and diligence of the Masters, and the proficiencie of the
Schollars in Pietie and Learning may appear, and deficiencie
censured as well; And that the Visitors see that the
Masters be not attracted by any other imployments, which
may divert them their diligent attendance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. That for the remedie of the great decay of Poesie,
and of abilitie to make Verse, and in respect of the common
ignorance of Prosodie, no School-master be admitted
to teach a Grammar School, in Burghs, or other considerable
Paroches, but such as after examination, shall
be found skilfull in the Latine Tongue, not only for Prose,
but also for Verse; And that after other trials to be made
by the Ministers, and others depute by the Session, Town,
and Paroch for this effect, that he be also approven by the
Presbyterie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. That neither the Greek Language, nor Logick,
nor any part of Philosophie be taught in any Grammar
School, or private place within this Kingdom, to young
Schollers, who thereafter are to enter to any Colledge,
unlesse it be for a preparation to their entrie there: And
notwitstanding of any progresse, any may pretend to have
made privately in these studies, yet in the Colledge hee shall
not enter to any higher Classe, then that wherein the Greek
Language is taught, and being entred, shall proceed orderly
through the rest of the Classes, until he finish the
Ordinary course of four years: Unlesse after due triall and
examination, he be found equall in Learning, to the best or
most part of that classe, to which he desires to ascend, by
over-leaping a mid-Classe, or to the best or most part of
those who are to be graduat, if he supplicate to obtain any
degree before the ordinary time. And also, That there be

condescend thereto; And otherwise that he be not admitted
to the Degree of Master of Arts.

IV. That none be admitted to enter a Student of the Greek
tongue in any Colledge, unlesse after triall he be found able

admonished of his errour, can readily shew how to correct
the same.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. That none be promoved from an inferiour Class of
the ordinary course to a superiour, unlesse he be found
worthy, and to have sufficiently profited: otherwise, that
he be ordained not to ascend with his con-disciples, and if
he be a Burser, that he lose his Burse. And namely, it is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. Because it is a disgrace to Learning, and hinderance
to Trades and other Callings, and an abuse hurtfull to
the Publick, that such as are ignorant and unworthy, be
honoured with a Degree or publick Testimony of Learning;
That therefore such triall be taken of Students, specially
of Magistrands, that those who are found unworthy,
be not admitted to the Degree and honour of Masters.

VII. That none who have entred to one Colledge for

the Masters of that Colledge from whence he cometh, be
timely advertised, that they may declare if they have any
thing lawfully to be objected in the contrary. And that
none be admitted, promoved, or receive Degree in any
Colledge, who was rejected in another Colledge for his unfitnesse
and unworthinesse, or any other cause repugnant
to good Order, who leaves the Colledge where he was for
eschewing of Censure, or chastising for any fault committed

The impunity of known Incendiaries and Malignants, as
by the course of Divine providence (permitting those who
have formerly escaped the hand of Justice to be the prime
instruments of our present Troubles) it is held forth for a
cause of the Wrath which yet burneth more and more; So
hath it been acknowledged before GOD in our publick
Humiliations, to be a maine cause of GODS Controversie
with the Land, and an accession to the guiltinesse of
the cruelty, villainy, and other mischiefs committed by
them and their followers: And to lye still under the guilt
after solemne Confession, were an high provocation of
GOD, and an heavy aggravation of our sinne; And on
the one part, doth grieve the Godly, discourage their
hearts, and weaken their hands, On the other part, doth
harden them who are already engaged, to persist in their
unnaturall and bloudy practices, heartneth others, who
have not hitherto avowed their Malignancy, openly to declare

Although the Lord hath shewn unto us great and sore

the much desired Work of Uniformity in Worship and Government

your Honours and wee did see the other day with joy of

I. It is the Humble Opinion of the Committee for regulating
that Excercise of reading and expounding the
Scriptures read upon the Lords Day, mentioned in the Directory,
That the Minister and People repair to the Kirk,
half an hour before that time at which ordinarily the Minister
now entreth to the publick Worship; And that, that
Exercise of reading and expounding, together with the ordinary
Exercise of Preaching, be perfected and ended at the
time which formerly closed the Exercise of publick Worship.

II. In the Administration of Baptisme, it will be convenient,
That, that Sacrament be administred in face of the

judgement of the Committee.

1. That Congregations be still tried and examined before
the Communion, according to the bygone practice of this
Kirk.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That there be no reading in the time of communicating;
but the Minister making a short Exhortation at
every Table, that thereafter there be silence during the time
of the Communicants receiving, except onely when the
Minister expresseth some few more sentences, sutable to the
present condition of the Communicants in the receiving,
that they may be incited and quikned in their Meditations
in the Action.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That distribution of the Elements among the Communicants
be universally used: And for that effect, that the
Bread be so prepared, that the Communicants may divide
it amongst themselves, after the Minister hath broken, and
delivered it to the nearest.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. That while the Tables are dissolving, and filling,
there be alwayes singing of some portion of a Psalme, according
to the custome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. That the Communicants both before their going to,
and after their coming from the Table, shall only joyne
themselves to the present publick Excercise then in hand.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. That when the Communion is to be celebrate in a Paroch,
one Minister may be imployed for assisting the Minister
of the Paroch, or at the most two.

7. That there be one Sermon of Preparation delivered in
the ordinary Place of publick Worship, upon the day immediatly
preceeding.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. That before the serving of the Tables, there be
onely one Sermon delivered to those who are to communicate,
and that in the Kirk where the Service is to be performed.
And that in the same Kirk there be one Sermon of
Thanksgiving, after the Communion is ended.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. When the Parochiners are so numerous, that their
Paroch Kirk cannot contain them, so that there is a necessity
to keep out such of the Paroch as cannot conveniently

Minister of the Paroch, may be ready, if need be, to give a
word of Exhortation in some convenient place appointed for
that purpose, to those of that Paroch, who that day are not to
Communicate; which must not be begun until the Sermon
delivered in the Kirk be concluded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. That of those who are present in the Kirk where the
Communion is celebrate, none be permitted to go forth
while the whole Tables be served, and the blessing pronounced,
unlesse it be for more commodious order, and in other
cases of necessity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. That the Minister who cometh to assist, have a special
care to provide his own Paroch, lest otherwise while he is
about to Minister comfort to others, his own Flock be left
destitute of preaching.

12. That none coming from another Paroch, shall be
admitted to the Communion, without a Testimonial from
their own Minister: And no Minister shall refuse a Testimonial
to any of his Paroch, who communicates ordinarily
at their own Paroch Kirk, and are without scandal in their
life for the time. And this is no wayes to prejudge any honest
Person, who occasionally is in the place where the
Communion is celebrate; or such as by death, or absence
of their own Minister, could not have a Testimonial.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. It is also the judgement of the Committee, That
the Ministers bowing in the Pulpit; though a lawful custome

the desires of the reverend Divines in the Synod of England,

The General Assembly, being most desirous and solicitous,
not onely of the establishment and preservation
of the Form of Kirk-government in this Kingdome, according
to the Word of GOD, Books of Discipline, Acts
of Generall Assemblies, and Nationall Covenant; But
also of an Uniformity in Kirk-government betwixt these
Kingdomes now more straitly and strongly united by the
late Solemne League and Covenant: And considering,
That as in former times there did, so hereafter there may
arise through the neernesse of Contagion, manifold mischiefs
to this Kirk from a corrupt Form of Government in
the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>: Like as the precious opportunity of
bringing the Kirks of Christ in all the three Kingdoms, to
an Uniformity in Kirk-government, being the happinesse
of the present times above the former; which may also by the
blessing of God, prove an effectuall meane, and a good foundation
to prepare for a safe and well-grounded Pacification,
by removing the cause from which the present Pressures and
bloodie Wars did originally proceed: And now the Assembly
having thrice read, and diligently examined the
Propositions (hereunto annexed) concerning the officers,
Assemblies, and Government of the Kirk; and
concerning the Ordination of Ministers, brought unto us
as the results of the long and learned Debates of the Assembly
of Divines sitting at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westminster</span></span>, and of the Treaty
of Uniformity with the Commissioners of this Kirk there
residing; After mature deliberation, and after tymous

without any substantiall alteration, by an Ordinance
of the Honourable Houses of the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>:
Which Ratification shall be timely intimate and made

Provided alwayes, That this Act shall be no wayes prejudiciall

so disposing, for the greater glory of his manifold and marvellous

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These dangers both from without and from within, together
with the remedies thereof, have been from time to
time represented and held forth, in the many publick Supplications
of this Kirk and Kingdom to the King, and in
their many Declarations, Remonstrances, Letters, Acts,
and other publick Intimations: Particularly by a necessary
Warning published by the Commissioners of the Generall
Assembly in January 1643; And by the Remonstrance of
the same Comissioners to the Convention of Estates in July
thereafter concerning the Dangers of Religion, and Remedies
of these Dangers: which Warning and Remonstrance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at that time had, by the blessing of GOD, very good and
comfortable effects. And now the General Assembly itself,
being by a speciall Providence, and upon extraordinary
occasions called together, while GOD is writing
bitter things against this Land in great Letters, which he
that runs may read: and knowing that we cannot be answerable
to GOD, nor our own consciences, nor the expectation
of others, if from this chief Watch Tower we should
give no Seasonable Warning to the City of GOD: While
we think of these things, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">For Sions sake we will not hold our peace,
and for Jerusalems sake we will not rest:</span></span> trusting that
GOD will give, though nor to all, yet to many, a seeing

is wise and he shall understand these things, prudent and he shall

That which we principally intend, is to hold forth (so
farre as the Lord gives us light) how this Nation ought to
be affected with the present Mercies and Judgements;
What use is to be made of the Lords dealings: And, what
is required of a people so dealt with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Had we been timely awaked, and taken warning, either
from the exemplary judgement of other Nations; or from
Gods threatnings by the mouths of his servants amongst our
selves; or from our owne former visitations, and namely,
The Sword, threatned and drawn against us, both at home
and from abroad, but at that time through the forbearance
of GOD, put up in the Sheath again, wee might have
prevented the miseries under which now we groane. But
the Cup of trembling, before taken out of our hands, is
again come about to us, that wee may drink deeper of it:
And although when these bloody Monsters, the Irish Rebels,
together with some degenerate, unnaturall, and
perfidious Countreymen of our own, did first lift up their
heads, and enter this Kingdome in a hostile way, it was
looked upon as a light matter, and the great judgement
which hath since appeared in it, not apprehended: yet now
wee are made more sensible, that they are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The rod of Gods
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
wrath, and the staffe in their hand</span></span>, which hath stricken us
these three times, is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his indignation. He hath shewed his people
hard things, and made us to drink the wine of astonishment</span></span>. Take
we therefore notice of the hand that smiteth us, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for affliction
cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the
ground. There is no evill in the City</span></span> nor Countrey <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which the Lord
hath not done.</span></span> He it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that formeth the light, and createth

is that hath his other <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arrows ready upon the string to shoot at us</span></span>,
the Pestilence and Famine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the next place let us apply our hearts to know, and to
search, and to seek out wisdome, and the reason of things,
and to understand the language of this present judgment,
and Gods meaning in it, For though <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Almighty giveth not
an accompt of any of his matters, and hath his way in the sea, and
his path in the deep waters which cannot be traced</span></span>; Yet he is pleased
by the light of his Word and Spirit, by the voice of our
own consciences, and by that which is written and ingraven
upon our judgement, as with the point of a Diamond
and a Pen of iron, to make known in some measure his
meaning unto his servants. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God hath spoken once, yea twice,
yet man perceiveth not</span></span>; Therefore now hath he made this rod
to speak aloud the third time, that we may <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hear the voice of
the rod, and who hath appointed it</span></span>. That which the rod pointeth
at, is not any guilt of Rebellion or disloyaltie in us, as
the Sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Belial</span></span> do slander and belye the Solemne League
and Covenant of the three Kingdoms, which we are so
farre from repenting of, that we cannot remember or mention
it without great joy and thankfulnesse to God, as that
which hath drawn many blessings after it, and unto which
God hath given manifold and evident testimonies, for no
sooner was the Covenant begun to bee taken in England;
but sensibly the condition of affairs there was changed to the
better; and though a little before the Enemy was coming
in like a Flood, yet as soon as the Spirit of the Lord did
lift up the Standard against him, from that day forward the
Waters of their Deluge did decrease.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And for our part, our Forces sent into that Kingdom,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in pursuance of that Covenant, have been so mercifully and
manifestly assisted, and blessed from Heaven (though in
the mids of many dangers and distresses, and much want and
hardship) and have been so farre instrumentall to the foyling
and scattering of two principal Armies; First, the
Marquesse of Newcastle his Army, And afterward, Prince
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ruperts</span></span> and his together; And to the reducing of two strong
Cities, York and Newcastle, that we have what to answer
the Enemy that reproacheth us concerning that businesse,
and that which may make iniquitie it self to stop her mouth.
But which is more unto us than all Victories, or whatsomever
temporal Blessing, the Reformation of Religion in
England, and Uniformity therein between both Kingdoms
(a principal end of that Covenant) is so far advanced,
that the English Service-Book, with the Holy-dayes,
and many other Ceremonies contained in it, together with
the Prelacy, the fountain of all these, are abolished and
taken away by Ordinance of Parliament; and a Directory
for the Worship of God in all the three Kingdoms, agreed
upon in the Assemblies and in the Parliaments of both Kingdoms,
without a contrary voice in either; the Government
of the Kirk by Congregational Elderships, Classical Presbyteries,
Provincial and National Assemblies, is agreed
upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, which
is also voted and concluded in both Houses of the Parliament
of England: And what is yet remaining of the intended
Uniformitie is in a good way; So that let our Lot fal in
other things, as it may, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Will of the Lord be done</span></span>; In this we
rejoyce, and will rejoyce, that our Lord Jesus Christ is
no loser, but a Conquerour, that his Ordinances take
place, that his Cause prevaileth, and the work of purging
and building his Temple goeth forward, and not backward.
Neither yet are we so to understand <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the voice of the rod</span></span> which
lyeth heavy upon us, as if the Lords meining were to pluck
up what he hath planted, and to pull down what he hath
builded in this Kingdom, to have no more pleasure in us,
to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">remove our Candlestick, and to take his Kingdom from us</span></span>: nay,
before that our God cast us off, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">glory depart from Israel</span></span>,
let him rather consume us by the Sword, and the Famine,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the Pestilence, so that he will but keep his own great
Name from reproach and blasphemy, and own us as his
people in Covenant with him. But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">now there is hope in Israel
concerning this thing</span></span>, we will beleeve <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that we shall yet see the
goodnesse of the Lord in the Land of the living:</span></span> We will not cast
away our confidence of a blessed peace, and of the removing
of the scourge and casting it in the Fire, when the Lord,
hath by it performed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his whole Work upon mount Sion and Jerusalem</span></span>,
much more will wee be confident of the continuance
of the blessings of the Gospel, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that glory may dwell in our Land.
This is the day of Jacobs trouble, but he shall be saved out of it:</span></span> And
the time is comming, when a new Song shall be put in our
mouths, and we shall say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This is our God, we have waited
for him, and he hath saved us.</span></span> Though the Lord smite us, it
is the hand of a Father, not of an Enemy, he is not consuming
us, but refining us, that we may come forth as Gold
out of the Fire. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We are troubled on every side; yet not distressed;
we are perplexed, but not in despaire; persecuted, but not
forsaken; cast downe, but not destroyed.</span></span> We know assuredly
there is more mercy in emptying us from Vessell to
Vessell, then in suffering us to settle on our Lees, whereby
our taste should remain in us, and our scent not be
changed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These things premised, we come to the true language of
this heavy judgement, and to the reall procuring causes thereof.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of
the house of Israel.</span></span> God is hereby shewing to great and smal
in this Land their work and their transgression, that they
have exceeded. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He openeth also their eare to discipline, and commandeth
that they return from iniquity.</span></span> We leave every Congregation
in the Land, every Family in every Congregation,
&amp; every Person in every Family to examine their own hearts
and wayes, &amp; to mourn for Congregationall, Domesticall,
and Personall sinnes: Cursed shall they be who have added
fuell to the fire, and now bring no water to extinguish it,
who had a great hand in the provocation, and bear no part
in the humiliation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let every one commune with his own conscience, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repent of his own wickednesse, and say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What have I
done</span></span>? Wee shall here touch onely the Nationall sinnes, or
at least more publick ones, then those of a Family or Congregation,
which we also intend for chief causes of a publick
Fast and Humiliation. If among our Nobles, Gentrie
and Barons, there have been some studying their own private
interests more then the publick, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seeking their own things
more then the things of Christ, or oppressing and defrauding the poore
sort and the needie, because it was in the power of their hand</span></span>: and
if among our Ministrie there have been divers Time-servers,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Who have not renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, whose hearts
have not been right before God, nor stedfast in his Covenant,</span></span> who
have been secretly haters of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Power of Godlinesse</span></span>, and of
Mortification; shall not GOD search all this out? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">who will bring to
light the hidden things of darknesse, and will make manifest the counsels of the
hearts.</span></span> In these also leaving all men to a judging and searching of
themselves, there are many other provocations which are apparent in all or many
of this Nation, from which, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">though they wash with nitre, and take much
sope</span></span>, yet they cannot make themselves clean: Because of these <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
Land mourneth</span></span>, and at these the Sword striketh.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As first, the contempt, neglect, and dis-esteem of the glorious Gospel; our
unbelief, unfruitfulnesse, luke-warmnesse, formality, and hardnesse of heart,
under all the means of Grace; our not receiving of Christ in our hearts, nor
seeking to know him, and glorifie him in all his Offices. The power of
Godlinesse is hated and mocked by many to this day, and by the better sort too
much neglected, and many Christian duties are not minded: as, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The not
speaking of our own words, nor finding of our own pleasure upon the Lords
day</span></span>: Holy and edifying conference both on that day, and at other occasions:
The instructing, admonishing, comforting, and rebuking one another, as Divine
Providence ministreth occasion. In many Families almost no knowledge nor
worship of GOD to be found: yea, there are among the Ministers who have
strenghtened the hearts and hands of the profane more then of the godly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and have not taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">heed to the ministrie which they have received
of the Lord to fulfill it.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Next, GOD hath sent the Sword to avenge the quarrel
of his broken Covenant: For besides the defection of many
of this Nation under the Prelats from our first Nationall Covenant,
a sinne not forgotten by GOD, if not repented
by men as well as forsaken, our latter Vows and Covenants
have been also foully violated, by not contributing our
uttermost assistance to this Cause, with our Estates and Lives;
by not endeavouring with all faithfulnesse, the discovery,
triall, and condigne punishment of Malignants,
and evil Instruments; yea, by complying too much with
those, who have not onely born Armes, and given their
personall presence and assistance, but also drawn and led on
others after them in the shedding of our Brethrens blood:
Therefore is our sinne made our punishment, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We are
filled with the fruit of our own wayes. These horns now push the sides
of Judah and Jerusalem, because the Carpenters when they ought
and might, did not cut them off</span></span>: And yet so this day the
course of Justice is obstructed: The Lord himself will execute
justice if men will not. But above all, let it bee deeply
and seriously thought of, that our Covenant is broken by
the neglect of a reall Reformation of our selves and others
under our power: let every one ask his own heart what
lust is mortified in him, or what change wrought in his life
since, more then before the Covenant? Swearing, Cursing,
Profanation of the Lords day, Fornication, and
other uncleannesse, Drunkennesse, Injustice, Lying,
Oppression, Murmuring, Repining, and other sorts of
Prophanenesse still abound too much both in the Countrey
&amp; in our Armies: yea, there is no Reformation of some
Members of publick Judicatories, which is a great dishonour
to God, and foul scandall to the whole Nation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thirdly, we have not glorified God according to the
great things which he hath done for us, nor made the right
use of former mercies: Since he loved us (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a Nation not
worthy to be beloved</span></span>) he hath made us precious and honourable,
but we have not walked worthy of this love: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We
waxed fat and kicked, forsaking God who made us, and lightly
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
esteeming the Rock of our salvation.</span></span> And this great unthankfulnesse
filleth up our Cup.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Forthly, Notwithstanding of so much guiltinesse, we
did send forth our Armies, and undertake great services
presumptuously, without repentance, and making our
peace with God, like the Children of Israel, who trusting
to the goodnesse of their cause, minded no more, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Which
of us shall goe up first.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is now high time, under the feeling of so great a burden
both of sinne and wrath to humble our uncircumcised
heart, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to put our mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope, to
wallow our selves in ashes, to clothe our selves with our shame as
with a garment</span></span>, to justifie Gods righteous judgements, to acknowledge
our iniquitie, to make our supplication to our Judge, and to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seek his face</span></span>, that he may <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pardon our sinne, and
heal our Land</span></span>. The Lord roareth, and shall not his children
tremble? The God of glory thundereth, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Highest
uttereth his voice, hailstones and coales of fire</span></span>, who will not fall
down and fear before him? The fire waxeth hot, and burneth
round about us, and shall any sit still and be secure? The
storm bloweth hard, &amp; shall any sluggard be still asleep? This
is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy; who
will not take up a lamentation? Let the Watchmen rouze up
themselves and others, and strive to get their own, and their
peoples hearts deeply affected, and even melted before
the Lord: Let every one turn from his evill way, and
cry mightily to God, and give him no rest till he repent of
the evill, and smell a savour of rest, and say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is enough.</span></span>
He hath not said to the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wee do not mourne as they that have no hope, but we will bear the
indignation of the Lord, because wee have sinned against him, untill
he plead our cause, and execute judgement for us.</span></span> And what
though our Candles be put out? So that our Sun shine:
What though our honour be laid in the dust? So that
GOD work out his own honour, yea, our happinesse
out of our shame. In vain have we trusted to the arm of
flesh: In the Lord our GOD is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salvation of Israel.</span></span>
No flesh must glory before him, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">but he that glorieth, must glory
in the Lord.</span></span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These duties of Humiliation, Repentance, Faith, Amendment
of life, and Fervent Prayer, though the principal,
yet are not all which are required at the hands of this
Nation, but men of all sorts and degrees, must timely apply
themselves to such other Resolutions and Actions as are
most suteable and necessary at this time: Which that all
may the better understand, and bee excited and encouraged
to act accordingly, let it be well observed, that the
present state of the Controversie and Cause is no other but
what hath been formerly professed before GOD and the
world, that is, The Reformation and Preservation of Religion,
The Defence of the Honour and Happinesse of the
King, and of the authority of the Parliament, together
with the maintenance of our Lawes, Liberties, Lives,
and Estates. We are not changed from our former principles
and intentions, but these who did fall off from us to
the contrary party, have now made it manifest, that these
were not their ends when they seemed to joyn with us:
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Therefore are they gone out from us, because they were not of us.</span></span>
And as our Cause is the fame, so the danger thereof is not
lesse, but greater then before, and that from two sorts of Enemies.
First, from open Enemies, we mean those of the
Popish, Prelatical, and Malignant Faction, who have displayed
a Banner against the Lord, and against his Christ, in
all the three Kingdoms, being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">set on fire of Hell</span></span>, and by the
special inspiration of Satan, who is full of fury; because he
knowes he hath but a short time to reigne. The Cockatrice
before hatched, is now broken forth into a Viper. The
danger was before feared, now it is felt; before imminent,
now incumbent; before our division, now our destruction
is endeavoured; before the Sword was fourbished
and made ready; now the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sword is made fat with Flesh, and
drunk with Bloud</span></span>, and yet it hungreth and thirsteth for more.
The Queen is most active abroad, using all means for
strengthening the Popish, and suppressing the Protestant
party; insomuch that Malignants have insolently expressed
their confidence, that her journey to France shall prove a
successeful Counsel, and that this Island, and particularly
this Kingdome, shall have a greater power to grapple with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before the next Summer, then any which yet we have encountred
with. The Irish Rebels have offered to the King to fend
over a greater number into both the Kingdomes: The hostile
intentions of the King of Denmark, if God be not pleased still
to divert and disable him, do plainly enough appear from
his own Letters, sent not long since to the Estates of this
Kingdome. In the mean time, the hellish crue under the
conduct of the excommunicate and forefaulted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Earle of Montrose</span></span>,
and of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alaster Mac-Donald</span></span>, a Papist and an Outlaw,
doth exercise such barbarous, unnaturall, horrid, and unheard
of cruelty, as is above expression: And (if not repressed)
what better usage can others not yet touched expect
from them, being now hardened and animated by the successe
which God hath for our humiliation and correction,
permitted unto them: and if they shall now get leave to
secure the High-Lands for themselves, they will not onely
from thence infest the rest of this Countrey, but endeavour
a diversion of our Forces in England, from the prosecution
of the ends expressed in the Covenant of the three Kingdoms,
toward which ends, as their service hath already advantageous,
so their continuance is most necessary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second sort of Enemies, from which our present
dangers arise, are secret Malignants and Dis-covenanters,
who may be known by these and the like Characters: Their
slighting or censuring of the publick Resolutions of this
Kirk and State: Their consulting and labouring to raise
Jealousies and Divisions, to retard or hinder the execution
of what is ordered by the publick Judicatories: Their
slandering of the Covenant of the three Kingdomes and expedition
into England, as not necessary for the good of
Religion, or safety of this Kingdome, or as tending to
the diminution of the Kings just power and greatnesse:
Their confounding of the Kings Honour and Authority,
with the abuse and pretense thereof, and with Commissions,
Warrants, and Letters, procured from the King,
by the Enemies of this Cause and Covenant, as if we could
not oppose the latter, without encroaching upon the former:
Their whetting of their tongues, to censure and
slander those whom GOD hath honoured as his chief Instruments
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in this Work: Their commending, justifying, or
excusing the proceedings of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James Grahame</span></span>,
sometime <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Earle
of Montrose</span></span>, and his Complices: Their conversing or intercommuning
by word of writ, with him, or other excommunicate
Lords, contrary to the nature of that Ordinance of
Christ, and to the old Acts of General Assemblies: Their
making merry, and their insolent carriage, at the News of
any prosperous successe of the Popish and Malignant Armies
in any of these Kingdomes: Their drawing of Parties
and Factions, to the weakning of the common Union: Their
spreading of Informations, That Uniformitie in Religion,
and the Presbyterial Government, is not intended by the
Parliament of England: Their Endeavours, Informations, &amp;
Sollicitations, tending to weaken the hearts &amp; hands of others
and to make them withold their assistance from this Work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let this sort of bosome Enemies, and dis-affected Persons,
be well marked, timely discovered, and carefully
avoided, lest they infuse the poison of their seducing counsels
into the mindes of others: Wherein let Ministers be
faithful, and Presbyteries vigilant and unpartial, as they
will answer the contrary to GOD, and to the General Assembly,
or their Commissioners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cause and the dangers thereof being thus evidenced,
unlesse men will blot out of their hearts the love of Religion,
and the Cause of GOD, and cast of all care of their Countrey,
Lawes, Liberties, and Estates, yea, all naturall
affection to the preservation of themselves, their Wives,
Children, and Friends, and whosoever is dearest to them
under the Sun (all these being in the visible danger of a present
ruine and destruction) they must now or never appear
actively, each one stretching himself to, yea beyond his
power. It is not time to dally, nor go about the businesse
by halfes, nor by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">almost</span></span>,
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">altogether</span></span> zealous: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cursed
be he that doth the Work of the Lord negligently, or dealeth
falsly in the Covenant of God.</span></span> If we have been so forward to
assist our Neighbour Kingdomes, shall we neglect to defend
our own? Or shall the Enemies of GOD be more active
against his Cause: than his People for it? GOD forbid.
If the Work being so far carried on, shall now mis-carry,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and fail in our hands, our own consciences shall condemne
us, and posterity shall curse us: But if wee stand stoutly
and stedfastly to it, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in our
hands, and all Generations shall call us blessed.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let Ministers stir up others by free and faithful preaching,
and by admonishing every one of his duty, as there shall be
occasion: And if it shall be the lot of any of them to fall
under the power of the Enemy, let them through the
strength of Christ, persevere in their integrity, choosing affliction
rather then sin, glorifying GOD, and not fearing
what Flesh can do unto them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let our Armies beware of ungodlinesse, and worldly
lusts, living godly, soberly, and righteously, avoiding
all scandalous carriage, which may give occasion to others
to think the worse of their Cause and Covenant, and remembring
that the eyes of GOD, Angels, and Men are upon
them: Finally, renouncing all confidence in their own
strength, skill, valour, and number, and trusting only to the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God of the Armies of Israel</span></span>, who hath fought, and will fight
for them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let all sorts both of high and low degree in this Kingdome,
call to minde their Solemne Covenants, and pay
their vows to the most High; and namely, that Article of
our first Covenant, which obligeth us not to stay nor hinder
any such Resolution, as by common consent shall be found
to conduce for the ends of the Covenant, but by all lawfull
means to further and promove the same; Which lyeth as a
Bond upon peoples consciences, readily to obey such orders,
and willingly to under go such burdens, as by the
publick and common resolution of the Estates of Parliament,
are found necessary for the prosecution of the War;
considering that the Enemy cannot bee suppressed without
a competent number of Forces, and Forces cannot be kept
together without maintenance, and maintenance cannot
be had without such publick Burdens; Which however
for the present, not joyous, but grievous, yet it shall be
no grief of heart afterwards, even unto the common fort,
that they have given some part of their necessary livelyhood,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for assisting so good a work. It is far from our thoughts,
that the pinching of some, should make others superfluously
to abound: It is rather to bee expected of the richer
sort, that they will spare and defalk, not onely the pride
and superfluity, both of apparel and diet, but also a part
of their lawful allowance in these things, to contribute the
same as a free will offering, beside what they are obliged
to, by Law or publick Order, after the example of godly
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nehemiah</span></span>, who for the space of twelve years, while the
walls of Jerusalem were a building, did not eat the bread of
the Governour, that hee might ease by so much the Peoples
Burthens and Bondage.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In our last Covenant, there is another Article which
(without the oblivion or neglect of any of the rest) we
wish may be well remembred at this time; namely, That
we shall assist and defend all that enter into this League and
Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof and
shall not suffer our selves, directly or indirectly, by whatsoever
Combination, Perswasion, or Terror, to be divided
and withdrawne from this blessed Union and Conjunction,
whether to make defection to the contrary part, or
to give our selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality
in this Cause: According to which Article, mens Reality
and integrity in the Covenant, will be manifest and demonstrable
as well by their omissions, as by their commissions;
as well by their not doing good, as by their doing of evil;
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He that is not with us, is against us, and he that gathereth not with
us, scattereth.</span></span> Whoever he be that will not, according to publick
order and appointment, adventure his person, or send
out these that are under his power, or pay the Contributions
imposed for the maintenance of the Forces, must be taken
for an Enemie, Malignant, and Covenant-breaker, and
so involved both into the displeasure of GOD, and Censures
of the Kirk, and no doubt into civil punishments also
to be inflicted by the State.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And if any shall prove so untoward and perfidious, their
iniquitie shall be upon themselves, and they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shall bear their

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
those who with purpose of heart cleave unto the Lord, and
whose hearts are upright toward his glory. When wee look
back upon the great things which GOD hath done for us,

and beautiful sight of his own glory in his Temple, we take
it for an argument that he hath yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">thoughts of peace</span></span>, and a
purpose of mercy toward us; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Though for a small moment he hath

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amidst the manifold troubles in which this Kingdome
hath been involved, and under which it still laboureth,
we greatly rejoyced when it was testified unto by us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
our reverend Brethren, and under your hands in your Letter,
and these Papers by them presented to us from you,
what progresse you had made in the much desired Work of
Uniformities and acknowledge that the same hath <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">comforted
us concerning our work and toile of our hands</span></span>, and seemeth to us as
an olive branch, to prognosticate the abating of the waters,
which overflow the face of the Earth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we consider, that you have walked in pathes unusuall,
which have not been haunted by Travellers there,
as the publick way, though pointed out as the good old way
by the Reformed Kirks, we do not wonder that you have
carefully adverted in every step to set foot upon sure ground;
When we behold that strong and high tree of Episcopacie
so deeply rooted by continuance of time not loosed of the
Branches, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stumpe of the root left in the Earth, with a
band of iron and brasse</span></span>, but pluckt up by the roots; We do
confesse that the Carpenters, though prepared have a hard
task, requiring time to hew it down, and root it up: And
when we call to minde how much the Service-Book hath
been cryed up as the only way of GODS Worship, how
many thereby have had their wealth, and how difficult it is
to forgoe the accustomed way; We admire the power and
wisdom of the good GOD who hath prospered you in
your way, and led you this length, through so many
straits, and over so many difficulties in so troublous a
time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do for our part not only admit and allow, but most
heartily and gladly embrace the Directory of Worship, as a
common Rule for the Kirks of GOD in the three Kingdoms,
now more straitly and firmly united by the solemne
League and Covenant; And we do all in one voice blesse
the Lord, who hath put it in the hearts, first, of the Reverend,
Learned, and Pious Assembly of Divines and
then, of the Honourable Houses of Parliament. To agree
upon such a Directory as doth remove what is none of
Christs, and preserve the purity of all his Ordinances, together
with Uniformity and Peace in the Kirk. Only we
have thought necessary, to declare and make known, That
the Clause in the Directory for the administration of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Lords Supper, which appointeth the Table to be so placed
that the Communicants may orderly sit about it, or at it, is
not to be interpreted as if in the judgement of this Kirk it
were indifferent for any of the Communicants not to come
to and receive at the Table; or as if we did approve the distributing
of the Elements by the Ministers to each Communicant,
&amp; not by the Communicants among themselves: In
which particulars, we still conceive and believe the order &amp;
practice of our own Kirk, To be most agreeable &amp; sutable to
the Word of GOD, the example of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the nature of that Heavenly Feast and Table. Neverthelesse,
in other particulars we have resolved, and do
agree, to do as ye have desired us in your Letter, That is,
not to be tenacious of old Customs, though lawfull in themselves,
and not condemned in this Directory, but to lay
them aside for the nearer Uniformitie with the Kirk of England,
now nearer and dearer to us than ever before; A
Blessing so much esteemed, and so earnestly longed for among
us, that rather than it faile on our part, we do most
willingly part with such practices and customs of our own,
as may be parted with safely, and without the violation of
any of Christs Ordinances, or trespassing against Scripturall
Rules, or our solemne Covenants.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do in like manner agree to, and approve the Proportions
touching Kirk-government and Ordination; and
have given power to our Commissioners who are to meet in
Edinburgh, to agree to, and conclude in our Name an
Uniformitie therein, betwixt the Kirks in both Kingdoms,
so soon as the same shall be without any substantiall alteration
Ratified by an Ordinance of the Honourable Houses
of the Parliament of England according to our Act of
Approbation sent to our Commissioners with you.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the returning of our Commissioners; though the
counsel and assistance of our Reverend Brethren might be of
good use to us in these difficult times, and their particular
stations and imployments importune the stay of these who
are come unto us, and the returne of these who stay with
you, yet preferring the publick good, and looking upon
the profit may redound unto all by their continuing with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you, we have satisfied your desire, &amp; renewed their Commission;
Praying GOD they may (as we are confident they shall)

TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT
MAJESTIE.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As our Record is on high, and our conferences within us
bear us witnesse, so the many former Supplications and
Remonstrances to your Majestie, from this Kirk and Kingdome,
our solemne Covenants, and the whole course of
our proceedings from time to time in the prosecution
of this Cause; Do make known to the World, and we trust
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also to your own consience, our loyaltie and faithful subjection,
and how far our intentions are from the diminution
of your Majesties just Power and Greatnesse; And although
the successe of many of our humble addresses to your Majesty,
hath been such as did frustrate our desires and hopes,
yet this hath not blotted our of our hearts our loyaltie, so
often professed before God and the World; but it is still our
Souls desire, and our Prayer to God for you, that your
Self and your Posterity may prosperously reigne over this
your antient and Native Kingdome, and over your other
Dominions. And now as we have published a solemn and
free Warning to the Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen,
Burrons, Ministers, and Commons of this Kingdome,
concerning the present affliction of this Nation, and their
sins procuring the same; So when we call to minde, that
God accepteth not the persons of men, and that the greatest
are not to be winked at in their sins; We assure our selves,
that the best and most reall testimony which we can
give at this present of the tendernesse and uprightnesse of
our affection to your Majesties true Happinesse is this our
humble and faithfull Representation of your Majesties great
and growing dangers, and the causes thereof. Of which,
if we should be silent, our consciences would condemne
us, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the stones themselves would immediatly cry out</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The troubles of our hearts are enlarged, &amp; our fear increased
in your Majesties behalf, perceiving that your Peoples patience
is above measure tempted, &amp; is like a cart prest down
with sheaves, and ready to break, while as beside many
former designes and endeavours to bring desolation and destruction
upon us, (which were (and we trust all of that
kinde shall be) by the marvellous and mercifull providence
of God discovered and disappointed). Our Countrey is now
infested, the blood of divers of our Brethern spilt, and
other acts of most barbarous and horrid cruelty exercised,
by the cursed crew of the Irish Rebels and their Complices
in the Kingdome, under the conduct of such as have
Commission and Warrant from your Majestie. And
unless we prove unfaithfull both to God and to your
Majestie, we cannot conceale another danger which is infinitely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
greater than that of your Peoples displeasure: Therefore
we the servants of the most high GOD, and your
Majesties most loyall Subjects in the humility and grief of
our hearts, fall down before your Throne, and in the
Name of our Lord and Master JESUS CHRIST,
who shall judge the world in righteousnesse, both great
and small, and in the Name of this whole Nationall Kirk,
which we represent, We make bold to warn your Majesty
freely, that the guilt which cleaveth fast to your Majesty
and to your Throne, is such, as (whatsoever flattering
preachers, or unfaithfull counsellours may say to the contrary)
if not timely repented, cannot but involve your
Self and your Posterity under the wrath of the ever-living
GOD, For your being guiltie of the shedding of the blood
of many thousands of your Majesties best Subjects; For
your permitting the Masse, and other Idolatry, both in
your own Family and in your Dominions; For your authorizing
by the Book of Sports the profanation of the Lords
Day; For your not punishing of publick scandals, and
much profanenesse in, &amp; about your Court; For the shutting
of your eare, from the humble and just desires of your
faithfull Subjects; For your complying too much with the
Popish party in many wayes, and namely, by concluding
the Cessation of Armes in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, and your embracing the
counsels of those who have not set GOD nor your good
before their eyes; For your resisting and opposing this
Cause, which so much concerneth the glory of GOD,
your own honour and happinesse, and the peace and safetie
of your Kingdomes; and for what other causes your Majesty
is most conscious, and may best judge and search your
own conscience (nor would we have mentioned any particulars,
if they had not been publike and knowne.) For
all which it is high time for your Majesty to fall down at the
footstool of the King of Glory, to acknowledge your offence
to repent timely, to make your peace with GOD through
JESUS CHRIST, (whose blood is able to wash away
your great sinne) and to be no longer unwilling that the Son
of GOD reign over you and your Kingdoms in his pure
Ordinances of Church-government and Worship. These
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
things if your Majesty do, it shall be no grief of heart unto
you afterward; a blessing is reserved for you, and you
shall finde favour with GOD, and with your People,
and with all the Churches of Christ; But if your Majesty
refuse to hearken to this wholsome counsell (which the
Lord forbid) we have discharged our own consciences,
we take GOD and Men to witnesse That we are blamelesse
of the sad Consequences which may follow, and we
shall wait upon the Lord, who, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when he maketh inquisition
for blood, will not forget the cry of the humble</span></span>. In the mean while,
beseeching your Majesty to take notice That we are not
staggering or fainting through diffidence of the successe of
this Cause and Covenant of the three Kingdoms, unto
which, as GOD hath already given manifold Testimonies
of his favour and blessing; so it is our stedfast and unshaken
confidence, that this is the Work and Cause of GOD,
which shall gloriously prevail against all opposition, and
from which, with the assistance of the grace of GOD,
we shall never suffer our selves to be divided or withdrawn,
but shall zealously and constantly in our severall Vocations,
endeavour with our Estates and Lives, the pursuing and
promoving thereof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That which we have concluded concerning Uniformity
in Religion between both Kingdoms, is to be humbly offered
to your Majestie from the Commissioners of this
Kingdom, for your Royall Consent and Ratification. Although
your Majestie was not pleased to vouchsafe us the
presence of your Commissioner, according to the supplication
of the Commissioners or the preceeding Generall Assembly,
yet we have proceeded with as much respect to
your Majesties honour, and as much remembrance of our
duty, as if your Royall Person had been present in the mids
of us: And we shall still continue our Prayers for you,
that GOD would graciously incline your heart to the
counsels of Truth and Peace, and grant unto your Majestie
a long and happy Raign, that we may live under you a peaceable
and quiet life, in all Godlinesse and Honestie.

These sweet Fruits of your long continued Labours in
the Work of the Lord entrusted to you, brought to
us at this time by these two of your number, whom you
were pleased to send, were received by us with no small joy
and rejoycing, as being, in great part, the satisfaction of
our Souls desire, in that so much longed for, so much prayed
for happy Uniformity of these Kirks and Kingdoms:
And an evident Demonstration to us, that the Lord hath
not, even in this time of his seen and felt displeasure, so
covered himself with the cloud of his anger, that our Prayers
should not passe through.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great and main difficulties through which the Lord
hath carried this Work, as we do acknowledge, ought
mainly to be made use of, for the praise and glory of his
power, who is the great Worker of all our works for us;
So your overcoming of them is to us no small Demonstration
of your zeal, wisdom, and faithfulnesse, which without
great Injurie both to the Lord the prime Worker, and
to you his instruments, we cannot but acknowledge, hath
been much manifested in the whole managing of this work
in your hands.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The full answer to all the particulars you write of in your
Letters, we leave to the Relation of those that come from
you, and are now appointed to return to you: And as with
much thankfulnesse we acknowledge your fidelity in what
ye have done already; so we have again renewed your Commission
for the continuance of your Imployment there, for
the perfecting of the Work so happily begun: For the furthering
whereof, as we shall not be wanting in our prayers
to GOD for his blessing upon your labours, so for your
help and assistance, we have appointed a commission to sit
at Edinburgh, to which at all occasions you may have your
recourse, as the exigence of the Work shall require.

then offer to represent it to you in a Letter: The Act herewith
sent, and ordained to be prefixed unto the Directory,
will sufficiently declare our hearty approbation of it: Our
judgement also concerning the proportions of Government
and Ordination, and our earnest desire to have the Work of
Uniformity promoved and perfected in that particular also,
will appear to you by the other Act which herewith you will
receive: Our zeal and desire to have that Work fully closed
with so much harmonie as becometh the work of GOD,
will appear to you in our resolution and answer to that particular
in the point of Excommunication, concerning which
you write.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These particular differences hinted in the Assemblies
Letter, for uniformitie with that Kirk so much endeared to

to us in duty, as the best Testimony which we can give
at this present to his Majesty, to remonstrate unto him
faithfully The great and growing dangers his Majesty is now
under, and the causes thereof. This Remonstrance we
have sent to you, to be presented to his Majesty, by such
means, and at such time, as you who are there upon the

And now dear Brethren go on with cheerfulnesse in the
Work of the Lord: Let no discouragement or opposition

therein masked with the pretences of Religion and libertie;
boasting also the pursuance of that his Remonstrance
against all deadly the opposers thereof, whether King or Parliament.
And having also considered another wicked and
treacherous Band of Union which the said Earle formerly
entred into with that excommunicate Rebell <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James Grahame</span></span>,
after the sentence of forfalture and the dreadfull sentence of
excommunication were pronounced against him, Oblieging
himself therein under solomne Oaths to joyne with that
forfaulted Rebell against this Kirk and Kingdome, and to
oppose all their publike resolutions for pursuance of the
happie ends of our said Covenants. All which, with his
vile reproachfull aspersions and most false calumnies against
this Kirk and State, and their publike and lawfull endeavours
and resolutions, with his other wicked and perfidious
practises at length discovered in the Proclamation of the
Committee of Estates, and the Declaration of the Commission
of the Assembly against the said perfidious Band and
Remonstrance, being gravely pondered and considered;
Together with his base treachery to the Estates, being intrusted
by them with ample Comission, and encouraged and
enabled for discharging thereof, with Mony Ammunition
and Arms in a good measure; Notwithstanding whereof contrary
to that great trust reposed in him. It is notour that not
only he did not joyne with the Forces raised for the defence
of this Kingdome, But rather on the contrary, actually
joining himself and his Forces with that excommunicate
Rebel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James Grahame</span></span>, and these unnatural bloody Rebels
his followers, did beleager Invernesse, a Towne Garrisoned
by the Estates for the Defence of that part of the Country.
And the Assembly, having also found that fair
means have been used for reclaiming of the said Earle
from that wicked and perfidious course, by publike Declarations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Proclamations, and particular Letters sent to himself
from those that had power in that behalf, And that notwithstanding
thereof and of Summonds direct against him
to answer to the premisses, often called, he doth not appear,
but still remains obstinate in his wicked courses. And after
mature deliberation having found his frequent fearful and
grosse perjuries, his perfidious and wicked conspiracies by
Band and Oath, with the publike Enemies of this Kirk and
Kingdom, and his other treacherous and wicked practises
contemptuously and pertinaciously persisted into, To be
heinous offences against God, and high contempt of all
Ecclesiastical and Civil authority. Therefore the Assembly
moved with the Zeal of God, do without a contrary
voice Decerne and Ordain the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">George</span></span> Earle of Seafort
to be summarly excommunicate, and declared to be one
whom Christ commandeth to be holden by all and every
one of the Faithful as an Ethnik and Publicane, and appoints
the sentence of excommunication to be pronounced by
Matter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Robert Blair</span></span> Moderator in the east Kirk of this Citie,
upon the next Lords day, being the 14 of this Moneth;
And that thereafter publike intimation be made thereof

4. Silence in the publike cause, not labouring to cure

5. Some account it a point of wisdome to speak ambiguously:

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Remedies.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. First, That Presbyteries make great conscience to
have all vacant places within their several bounds filled
with godly and able men, where ever they be to be found:
and that under pretence of being a helper, or second to another,
none be taken in, but such as are able for the
same charge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Whereas it is known, that private tryall in Presbyteries
are for the most part perfunctorious, the Brethren are
hereby exhorted to be more serious, and faithfull herein,
as they will be answerable to Christ, the Chief Shepherd:
and in a way previous thereto, that Brethren be free, in
loving admonition one of another secretly, from time to
time; and that whosoever keeps not the Presbyterie or Synod,
after grave admonitions may come under further
censures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. That accuracie be used as visitation of Kirks, and that
the Elders one by one (the rest being removed) be called
in, and examined upon oath upon the Ministers behaviour
in his calling and conversation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. That course be taken to divide Congregations in parts,
and by the help not only of Elders in their severall parts,
but of neighbors also, the evils, and neglect of persons
and families, may be found out and remedied.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. That every Minister be humbled for his former failings,
and make his peace with God, that the more effectually he
may preach repentance, and may stand in the gap, to turne
away the Lords wrath: runing between the Porch and the
Altar, fighing and crying for all the abominations of the
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Speciall care would be had, that Ministers have their
conversation in heaven, mainly minding the things of God,
and exercising faith for drawing life out of Jesus Christ the
fountain of life, arming themselves thereby with power against
the contagion and wickednesse of the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Care would be had of godly conference in Presbyteries,
even in time of their refreshment, and the
Moderator is to look to it, that good matter be furnished
thereto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. It is also very necessary for every Minister that would
be fruitfull in the work of the Lord, to bring home the
Word of God to his own heart and conscience, by Prayer
and Meditation, both before and after the publike ordinance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. Use would be made of the roll of the Parish, not onely
for examination, but also for considering the severall
conditions and dispositions of the people, that accordingly
they may be admonished, and particularly prayed for by the
Ministers in secret.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. It is very expedient that Ministers have more communion
among themselves for their mutuall stirring up, and
strengthening of their hands in the Lords work, and rectifying
of these who are not incorrigible.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
11. That Ministers in all sorts of companie labour to bee
fruitfull, as the Salt of the earth, seasoning them they meet
with, not only forbearing to drink healths (Satans snare,
leading to excesse) but reproving it in others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
12. All Ministers would be carefull to cherish the smoaking
flax of weak beginnings in the wayes of God, and
ought couragiously to oppose all mockers and revilers of the
godly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
13. As at all times, so specially now when the Lord
is calling us all to an account; it becomes the Ministers of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Christ, with all diligence and faithfulnesse, to improve
their Ministerie to the utmost, to be instant in season and
out of season; yea, even singally to imploy their time in
private, in reading of, and meditating on Scripture, that
the word of God may dwell plentifullie in them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
14. That the providing the Armies with Ministers be preferred
to any congregation, and these who are appointed to
attend the same, and are deficient, be without delay severelie
censured according to the Act of the General Assembly;
And that all Ministers not only in publike, pray for
our Armies, specially these that are to incounter with the
bloody enemie within the land, but also continually bear
them up before the Lord, that their lives being reformed,
their hearts and hands may be strengthned, and their undertaking
at last blessed of GOD; with successe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
15. That beside all other scandals, silence or ambiguous
speaking in the publike cause, much more detracting
and disaffected speaches be seasonablie censured; and
to this effect, all honest hearted Brethren would firmlie unite
themselves in the Lord, the younger honouring the
elder, and the elder not despising the younger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
16. And finallie, both for the corruption of the Ministerie
and remedies thereof, we refer the brethren to the
Act of the Generall Assemblie at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span> 1596. revived

of their ambitious and treacherous designes, against Religion,
the priviledges of Parliament, and the Lawes and
Liberties of the Kingdom: Neither hath that miserable crew
been wanting to their owne ends but for many years together
hath desperatly pursued their resolutions in Arms; And
was likely to have prevailed, if the Lord had not put himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the breach, and furnished you with much Patience,
Wisdom, Courage, and Constancy, in the midst of many
difficulties and distresses; and at last with so glorious and
triumphing a successe, that the Enemy hath fallen every
where before you, and there is none left to appear against
you. These things as they be the matter of our refreshment
and of your glory, so doe they lay a strong obligation upon
your Honours to walke humbly with your God, and to
improve the power he hath put into your hands for the advancement
of the Kingdom of his Son, and bringing
forth of the head-Stone of his House. The slow progresse
of the work of God hath alwaies been the matter of our
sorrow, which is now increased by the multiplication of the
spirits of errour and delusion, that drowne many souls into
perdition, and so strengthen themselves that they shall afterward
be laboured against, with more pains then successe,
if a speedy and effectuall remedie be not provided. And
therefore as the servants of the living God, who not onely
send up our supplications daily for you, but have hazarded
our selves in your defence, We do earnestly beseech your
Honors in the bowels of Jesus Christ, to give unto him
the glory that is due unto his Name, by a timous establishing
all his Ordinances in the full integritie and power
thereof, according to the League and Covenant. As long
as the Assembly of Divines was in debate, &amp; an enemy in the
fields, we conceived that these might be probable grounds
of delay, which being now removed out of the way, we
do promise to our selves from your Wisdom, Faithfulnesse,
and Zeale, the perfiting of that which was the main
ground of our engagement, and a chief matter of consolation
unto us in all our sad and heavy sufferings, from the
hand of a most cruell Enemy. We know that there is a
generation of men who retard the work of Uniformity, and
foment jealousies betwixt the Nations, studying if it were
possible, to break our bands asunder; But we trust, that
he that sits in the Heaven will Laugh, and that the Lord
shall have them in derision, that he shall speak to them in
his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure, and notwithstanding
of all that they can do, set his King upon his holy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hill of Sion, and make these Nations happy in the sweet
fruits of Unity in Truth and Peace. The searcher of hearts
knows that we desire to hold fast the band of our Covenant,
as sacred and inviolable; being perswaded that the breach of
so solemne a tye could not but hasten down upon our heads a
curse and vengeance from the righteous Judge of the world,
and involve these Kingdoms in sader calamities then they
have yet seen, And we abhor to entertain any other thought
of you: Nay we are confident that your Honours will seriously
indeavour the prosecution of all these ends designed in
the Covenant, and the bringing these Nations unto the
neerest conjunction both in judgement and affection, especially
in these things that concern Religion, which with
out all controversie, is the readiest and surest way of attaining
and securing the Peace and Prosperity of both Kingdoms.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Your late and seasonable testimony given to the Truth
of the Gospel, and your affection to the Peace of the
Kingdoms, manifested in your humble Remonstrance and
Petition to the Honorable Houses of Parliament, hath so
revived the remembrance of your former Faith and Zeal,
and proclaimed you the worthy seed of so noble ancestors in
that famous City, As we cannot but acknowledge with all
thankfulnesse the grace of God bestowed on you, and stirre
you up to take notice, how since you were precious in the
Lords sight, you have been ever Honurable, The Lord
hath loved you, given men for you, and people for your
life: What an honour was it in the dayes of old, when the
fire of the Lord was in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zion</span></span>, and
his furnace in your <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></span>
(even in Queen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Maries</span></span> dayes) that there were found in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
you men that loved not their lives unto the death? What
a glory in after time, when Satan had his Throne and
Antichrist his Seat in the midst of you, that there were
still found not a few that kept their Garments clean?
But the greatest praise of the good hand of God upon
you hath been in this, That amidst the many Mists of
Errour and Heresie which have risen from the bottomlesse
pit, to bespot the face and darken the glory of the Church,
(while the Bride is a making ready for the Lamb) you have
held the Trueth, and most piously endeavoured the setling
of Christ upon his Throne. We need not remember how
zealous you have been in the Cause of God, nor how you
have laid out your selves and estates in the maintenance thereof,
nor how many acknowledgements of the same you
have had from the Honourable Houses, nor how precious
a remembrance will be had of you in after ages for your selling
of all to buy the Pearl of price: We only at this time do
admire, and in the inward of our hearts do blesse the Lord
for your right and deep apprehensions of the great and important
matters of Christ in his Royall Crown; and of the
Kingdoms in their Union, while the Lord maketh offers to
bring our Ship (so much afflicted and tolled with tempest)
to the safe Harbour of Trueth and Peace. Right memorable
is your Zeal against Sects and Sectaries; your care of
Reformation, according to the word of God, and the example
of the best Reformed Churches; your earnest endeavours
and noble adventures, for preserving of the rights and
priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Kingdomes,
Together with his Majesties just power and greatnesse; and
your high profession, that it is not in the power of any humane
authority to discharge or absolve you from adhearing
unto that our (so solemnly sworn) League and Covenant,
or to enforce upon you any sense contrary to the letter of the
same, Besides your other good services done unto the Lord
and to us, in the strengthening of the hands of the reverend
Assembly of Divines, and of our Commissioners in their
asserting of the government of Christ, (which the more it
be tried will be ever found the more precious Truth), and
vindicating of the same from the usurpation of man, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
contempt of the wicked. These all as they are so many testimonies
of your Pietie, Loyaltie, and undaunted resolution
to stand for Christ; So are they and shall ever be so many
obligations upon us your Brethren, to esteem highly of
you in the Lord, to bear you on our brests before him night
and day, and to contribute our best endeavours, and to improve
all opportunities for your encouragement. And now
we beseech you in the Lord, Honorable and welbeloved,
go on in this your strength, and in the power of his might
who hath honoured you to be faithful, stand fast in that liberty
wherewith Christ hath made you free; And in the
pursuance of this truth, we are confident, as you have, so
you will never cease to study the Peace and neerer conjunction
of the Kingdoms, knowing that a threefold cord is not
easily broken. Now the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and
God even our Father, which hath loved and honoured you,
and given you everlasting consolation, &amp; good help through
grace, comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good
word and work.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amongst other fruits of this our precious liberty, after
such dissipation by Sword and Pestilence, to meet again,
we account it not the least, to have the opportunity of making
a publike Declaration of our earnest affection to all our
brethren of that Nation, and especially your selves of the
Reverend Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westminster</span></span>. When we were lately
in a very low condition, we may say that our own sufferings
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and fears, although imbittered with the sense of the Lords
displeasure against our luke warmneese and unfaithfulnesse;
yet they did not so take up our heart, but that room was
left to congratulate with the Lords people there in all their
successes, and to condole with them in all their dangers;
And if at any time any here seemed to be more jealous then
godly jealousie would allow, we know not how it can be
imputed to any thing else, but to the vehemencie of ardent
affection, and impatient desire to have our brethren there
and us joyned neerer to Christ, and neerer to one another in
all his Ordinances; and especially is Presbyterial Government,
so well warranted by the Word, and approven by
experience of our own and other reformed Churches;
Wherein your long and unwearied endeavours have been
blessed with a large increase, which yet hath proved still
a seed unto a further and more glorious expected harvest.
There could not be wished by mortal men a fairer opportunity
then is cast in your laps, being invited and charged by
so high an authority, to give so free and publike a testimony
to those truths, which formerly many of the Lords precious
ones by tongue and pen, by tears and blood have more
privately asserted; The smallest of Christs truths (if it be
lawful to call any of them small) is of greater moment,
then all the other businesses that ever have been debated
since the beginning of the world to this day; But the highest
of honours and heaviest of burdens is put upon you, to
declare out of the sacred records of Divine Truth, what is
the prerogitive of the Crown and extent of the Scepter of
Jesus Christ, what bounds are to be set between Him ruling
in his House, and powers established by God on Earth,
how and by whom his House is to be governed, and by
what wayes a restraint is to be put on those who would pervert
his Truth, and subvert the faith of many. No doubt
mountains of oppositions arise, and gulfs of difficulties
open up themselves in this your way; But you have found
it is God that girdeth you with strength and maketh your
way perfect and plain before you, who hath delivered, and
doth deliver, and will yet deliver. We need not put you
in minde that as there lyeth at this time a strict eye on all, so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in a special manner both you and we are ingaged to interpose
our selves between God and these Kingdomes; between
the two Nations, between the King and the People, for
averting of deserved wrath, for continuing and increasing
of a well grounded Union, for procuring as far as in us
lyeth a right settling of Religion and Church-Government;
That when we shall sleep with our fathers the Posterity
here and abroad may be reaping the fruits of our labours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are fully assured of your constant and sedulous promoving
of this blessed Work, and of the Lords assisting and
carrying you on therein: And are confident that your late
experience and present sense of the great danger and fearfull
confusion flowing from the rife and grouth of Sects and
Sectaries not suppressed, hath stirred up in your hearts most
fervent desires, and careful endeavours for remedying the
same, wherein we exhort you to continue and abound;
knowing that your labours shall not be in vain in the Lord,
to whose rich grace we commend you, and the work in
your hands.

The conscience of our dutie to God obliging us to give a

many, and so little owned by others: The laudable custome
and example of correspondency between Neighbouring
Churches, exhorting, encouraging, and (in case of
publike scandal) admonishing in love one another, as
well as single Brethren ought to admonish one another in
love, in the case of private offence: Our neerer relation and
more special affection to our Brethren of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, making
us to sympathize with them in their danger and affliction as
our own, both Kingdomes being united as one entire Body
in one Covenant, for pursuing the common cause and ends
therein expressed: Yea, common reason and experience it
self teaching us that we have no cause to conceive our Religion,
the liberties of this Church, or our selves to be in a
condition of safety, when ever the enemies of our Religion
and Liberties are growing to a prevalency in the Neighbour
Kingdom. Any one of these considerations, much more
all of them together, cry aloud upon us to break our silence
in this present Juncture of Affaires; yet we hope to expresse
our selves both concerning the present Dangers and present
Duties, as in a conscionable and Brotherly freedome, so in,
a fair and in offensive way; for we have no pleasure nor purpose
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to provoke any Person or Party whatsoever, not to encrease,
but to endeavour the allaying and composing of the
present unhappy differences. If any shall offend at our discharging
our conscience &amp; doing our duty, yet we shall rather

First of all, whatsoever the present discouragements,
difficulties or dangers are, or whatsoever for the future they
may be, we cannot but commemorate to the glory of God,
and we doubt not it shall be remembred to his glory in the
Church throughout all ages, How great a salvation his
Mighty Hand and Outstretched Arme hath wrought for
these three Kingdomes; How he stirred up the Spirits of his
People in this Kingdome ten yeares agoe, to begin to shake
off the Yoke of Prelatical tyrannie, and of Popish Ceremonies
obtruded upon us, contrary to the Lawes of God and
Men; How he led us on from so small beginnings, &amp; from
one degree to another, till we were United in a National
Covenant; How he gave us a Banner to be displayed for the
Truth, and so blessed us in the prosecution of that Covenant,
that the Kings Majesty was graciously pleased upon
the humble Petitions of his Loyal Subjects in this Nation,
to indict a General Assembly and Parliament for healing the
grievances of Church and State respectively, As likewise to
grant his Royal consent for Confirming and Ratifying by
Acts of Parliament our National Covenant, &amp; the Government
and Liberties of this Church. After which the new
Troubles raised against us by the malice and treachery of our
enemies, did occasion the first expedition of this Nation into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, (upon which followed the calling of the Parliament
there, and the large Treaty) and in the issue, the return
of that Army was with an Olive branch of Peace,
and not without the beginnings of a Reformation in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>:
In which work while the Parliament was interrupted and opposed,
and a bloody War begun with great successe on that
side which opposed the Parliament and the begun Reformation,
from whence also did accrew great advantage to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Popish Party (whereof the Cessation of Arms concluded in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> may be in stead of many testimonies;) Commissioners
were sent hither from both Houses, earnestly inviting and
perswading to a nearer Union of the Kingdomes, and desiring
Assistance from this Nation to their Brethren in that
their great distresse; And this by the good Hand of God
produced the solemne League and Covenant of the three
Kingdomes, to the terrour of the Popish and Prelatical party
our common Enemies, and to the great comfort of such as
were wishing and waiting for the Reformation of Religion;
and the recovery of just Liberties. And although for
the conjunction of the Kingdomes in Covenant, and
Armes (being a speciall means tending to the extirpation
of Popery) and strengthening the true Reformed Religion;
this Kingdome hath been invaded and infested by the bloody
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Rebels aided and strengthened by some degenerate
and perfidious Countrey-men of our owne: Although also
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> there were not wanting incendiaries, who hating
and envying nothing more then the Union of the Kingdomes
in such a Covenant, were very vigilant to catch, and
active to improve all occasions of making divisive motions,
and creating Nationall Differences; Yet God hath been
graciously pleased to break our Enemies strength at Home
when it was greatest, and to guide us through these Jealousies
and Differences fomented by disaffected Persons between
the Kingdomes; So that in stead of a splitting upon
these Rocks (the thing hoped for by our Enemies) there
was a peaceable and friendly parting: Since which time
God hath further blessed our Army at Home, to the
expelling of the Enemie out of our own Borders. Nor
can we passe in silence the happy progresse which hath been
made in the Reformation of the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>; He
that hath brought the Children to the birth, can also give
strength to come forth; And hee whose hand did cast out
Prelacie and the Book of Common Prayer (although
strongly rooted in standing Lawes;) and who enclined
the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> to owne no other Church Government
but the Presbyterial, (Though it bee not yet
fully settled according to the Word of God, and the example
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the best Reformed Churches) can as easily encline
when hee thinks good both the King and them, and
the body of that Kingdome to a thorow and perfect Reformation.
He that made the Assemblies and Parliaments of
both Kingdomes to agree upon one directory for the Publike
Worship of God, can also when he will make an agreement
in the other Parts of Uniformitie, Confession
of Faith, form of Church Government, and Catechisme;
In all which there hath beene also a good progresse made in
the Reverend and Learned Assemblie of Divines through
the good hand of God so long upon them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having now seen so much of God both in the beginning
and progresse of this his great Work, And his Hand having
done so wondrous things for his People in their greatest
extremities of danger, and having discovered and defeated
the plots of Enemies, making them fall even by their own
Counsels; These things wee resolve to keep still fixed in
our hearts, and as memorials before our eyes, that remembring
the Works of the Lord, and the Years of the Right
Hand of the most High, wee may neither want matter of
Praies and thanksgivings, nor experience to breed hope.
Although the building of the House of the Lord in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
be not yet, after so long expectation, finished, and now
also the work ceaseth, Yet wee doe from our hearts blesse
the Lord for the laying of the Foundation, and for so much
progresse as hath been made in the Work; Having still confidence
in the Almighty, to whom nothing is impossible or
too hard, that every Mountaine which doeth or shall stand
in the way shall become a plaine, and that the Head-stone
shall bee brought forth with shoutings of Joy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Grace, Grace

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neverthelesse, we are also very sensible of the great and
imminent dangers into which this Common Cause of Religion
is now brought by the growing and spreading of most
dangerous errours in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, to the obstructing &amp; hindering
of the begun Reformation, as namely (beside many others)
Socinianisme, Arminianisme, Anabaptisme, Antinomianisme,
Brownisme, Erastianisme, Independency, and that which
is called (by abuse of the word) Liberty of Conscience, being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
indeed Liberty of Errour, Scandall, Schisme, heresie,
dishonouring God, opposing the Truth, hindering Reformation;
and seducing others; Whereunto we adde those
Nullifidians, or men of no Religion, commonly called
Seekers: Yea, wee cannot but look upon the Dangers of
the true Reformed Religion in this Island, as greater now
then before; Not onely for that those very principles &amp; fundamentals
of Faith which under Prelacy, yea, under Popery
it self, were generally received as uncontroverted, are
now by the Scepticisme of many Sectaries of this time either
oppugned, or called in question; But also, because in
stead of carrying on the Reformation towards perfection,
that which hath beene already built is in part cast down,
and in danger to be wholly overthrowne through the endeavours
of Sectaries to comply with many of the Prelaticall
and Malignant, and even the Popish party; and their joyning
hand in hand, and casting in their lots, and interweaving
their interests together in way of Combination, against
the Covenant and Presbyteriall Government; Yea,
the unclean spirit which was cast out, is about to enter againe
with seven other spirits worse then himselfe, and so
the latter end like to be worse then the beginning.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are extremely sorry that we have cause to aggravate
these evils from the crying sin of breach of Covenant, Whereof
if we should hold our peace, yet according to the
Word of the Lord; other Nations will say, and many
among them do say, Wherefore hath the Lord done thus
unto this People? and what meaneth the heat of this great
anger? And they answer one another, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Because they have forsaken
the Covenant of the Lord their God.</span></span> We would not be
understood as if we meant either to Justifie this Nation, or
to charge such a sin upon all in that Nation. We know the
Covenant hath been in divers particulars broken by many in
both Kingdomes, the Lord pardon it, and accept a Sacrifice;
And wee doe not doubt but there are many seven
thousands in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> who have not onely kept themselves
unspotted, and retained their integrity in that businesse,
but doe also mourne and groane before the Lord for that sin
of others. Yet we should but deny our own sence and betray
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Truth, if we should not resent so great a sinne and
danger, as is the breach of a solemne Covenant, sworn
with hands lifted up to the most High God: Which breach
however varnished over with some colourable and handsome
pretexts, one whereof is the Liberty &amp; Common Right of
the free People of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>,
as once <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saul</span></span> brake a Covenant
with the Gibeonites, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In his Zeal to
the Children of Israel and Iudah</span></span>:
Yet God could not then, and cannot now be mocked;
Yea, it is too apparent and undeniable, that among those
who did take the Covenant of the three Kingdomes, as
there are many who have given themselves to a detestable
indifferency or neutralitie, so there is a Generation
which hath made defection to the contrary Part; Persecuting
as far as they could that true Reformed Religion, in
Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government, which
by the Covenant they ought to preserve against the common
Enemies; hindering and resisting the Reformation and
Uniformity, which by the Covenant ought to bee endeavoured;
preserving and tolerating those cursed things which
by the Covenant ought to be extirpate, especially Heresie and Schisme,
encroaching upon, yea offering violence unto the
Rights, Priviledges, and Authority of Magistracie, Protecting
and assisting such as by the Covenant ought to have
been brought to condigne triall and punishment, and persecuting
those who by the Covenant ought to be assisted and
defended; Endeavouring also a breach in stead of a firme
Peace and Union between the Kingdomes: So that there is
not any one Article of the Solemne League and Covenant
which hath not been sinfully and dangerously violated before
God, Angels, and Men. Now if a Covenant for
the preservation and Reformation of Religion, the Maintenance
and Defence of Liberties was justly thought a
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fit and excellent mean</span></span>, not
only to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">strengthen and fortifie</span></span> the
Kingdomes against the common Enemie of the true Reformed
Religion, publike Peace and Prosperity; But also
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to acquire the favour of Almightie GOD towards the three
Kingdomes, of England, Scotland, and Ireland,</span></span> as is expressed
in the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons
for the taking of the Covenant, dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">February 2. 1643</span></span>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Surely then the Authors and chief Instruments of the breach
of that Covenant, are to be looked upon as those who
strengthen the hands of the common Enemie, and provoke
the wrath of Almighty God against these Kingdomes. Yea,
if this Covenant was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Soveraigne
and onely meanes of the recovery</span></span>
of these embroiled bleeding Kingdoms, as is expressed in
the exhortation of the Assembly of Divines to the taking of
the Covenant, approved and ordered to be Printed by the
House of Commons; The despising, refusing, and casting
aside of that remedy, must needs render the disease much
more desperate. And if by the Declaration of both Kingdomes
joined in Arms, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno 1643.</span></span> such as would not take
the Covenant, were declared <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to be publike Enemies to their
Religion and Countrey, and that they are to be censured and punished as
professed Adversaries and Malignants.</span></span> Who seeth not now a
strange falling away from these first Principles and Professions,
among these who either magnifie and cry up, or at least
connive at and comply with such as have not taken the Covenant,
yea, are known Enemies to it, and cry down such
as are most zealous for it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this case, while in the Neighbour Kingdom, the staves
of Beauty and Bands, Covenant &amp; Brother-hood are broken
by many, the home of Malignants and Sectaries exalted,
the best affected born down, Reformation ebbing, Heresie
and Schisme flowing; It can hardly be marvelled at by any
Person of prudence and discretion, if we be full of such
feares and apprehensions as use to be in those who dwell near
a House set on fire, or a Family infected, especially being
taught by the sad experience of these Prelatical times, how
easily a Gangrene in the one half of this Island may spread
through the whole; Knowing also the inveterate and insatiable
malice of the Enemies of this Cause and Covenant
against this Church and Kingdome; which we cannot be
ignorant of, unlesse we would shut our eyes &amp; stop our ears.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our present purpose leadeth us to touch somewhat of the
proceedings of the Army in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> this Summer, so far as
Religion is therein concerned; As we are confident, divers
have gone a long with them in the simplicity of their
hearts, &amp; we presume not to judge the thoughts &amp; intentions
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of any, it being Gods owne prerogative, to bring to
light the hidden things of darknes, and to make manifest the
counsels of the hearts; So it cannot be denied, that upon
these passages and proceedings hath followed the interrupting
of the so much longed for Reformation of Religion, of
the setling of Presbyteriall government, and of the suppressing
of heresies and dangerous errors, (which works the
Parliament had taken in hand) the retarding and delaying
the relief of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, the sowing of the seeds of another War
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, the strengthning of the hand of the Malignant &amp;
Episcopall party, the weakning and wounding both of
Magistracy and Ministery: In all which, whether the Army
bee blamelesse and innocent, from ministring occasion
to so great evils, or whether there be not cause for them to
repent and do the first works, and to practise more of that
love, moderation, and meeknesse of Spirit, and of that
zeal against Malignants and Prelaticall persons, which they
have from the beginning professed, and the want whereof
(when suspected in others) they did so much censure; or
whether there be such a thing among them, as adjoyning
with those against whom, and against whose with whom
the Covenant was taken; We leave them in all these to the
search and examination of their own consciences, that they
may stand or fall unto God. For our part, we cannot conceive
how the Proposals of that Army for setling of a Peace,
do in point of Religion consist with the solemn League and
Covenant, or with the Propositions of peace, formerly
agreed upon by both Kingdomes; there being so considerable
omission of divers materiall desires contained in
those former Propositions, concerning the abolition of
Prelacy; concerning the injoyning of the taking of the
Covenant by all his Majesties Subjects, under such penalties
as the Parliaments should agree upon; concerning
the setling of Religion in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, according
to the Covenant, in such manner as both Houses of
Parliament shall agree on, after advice had with the
Assembly of Divines, concerning the setling of uniformity
between the Churches of God in both Kingdomes, according
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the Covenant, in such manner as shall be agreed
on by both Houses of the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and by the
Church, and Kingdome of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, after advice had with
the Divines of both Kingdomes; Also concerning an Act
of Parliament to confirm the calling and sitting of the Assembly
of Divines: All which, with some other particulars
concerning Religion, expressed in the former Propositions,
if they should now be omitted in the setling of a
Peace, the progresse already made, not only in the Assembly
of Divines, but in the Houses of Parliament, in setling
Presbyteriall Government, with the Confession of
Faith, yea the Directory of publike Worship (though
agreed upon by the Assemblies and Parliaments of both
Kingdomes) shall bee but so much lost labour. But beside
these omissions it may be justly doubted whether there be
not in the Proposals of the Army, somewhat for Episcopocy,
and against the Covenant; For wee cannot understand
the eleventh Proposall, in any other sense, but that it
supposeth the continuance of the Ecclesiastical office of Bishops
or Prelats, as well as of any other Church Officers, and
taketh no more from the Prelats, but coercive power or jurisdiction
extending to civil penalties, which indeed belongeth
to no Ecclesisticall Officers. In the twelfth Proposall, wee
do not see, how it can avoid or shun the toleration of Popery,
Superstition, Heresie, Schisme, Profannesse, or whatsoever
works of darknesse shall be practised by such as dispise the
publicke Worship of God in the Church, &amp; have the most unlawful
and wicked meetings else where under a profession of
Religious duties, exercises or ordinances. From the thirteenth
Proposall, we can make no other result, but that in stead
of enjoyning the taking of the Covenant, under such penalties
as the Parliaments in their wisdome shall agree upon,
the former ordinance of Parliament enjoyning the taking of
it, is desired to be repealed: and then what may bee the danger
of those that have taken, or shall take an oath of that kinde, not
enjoyned nor ratified by authority, wee leave it to be judged
by those who know best the Lawes of that Kingdome.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One thing more wee Cannot passe, that whereas in the
Armies Declaration, or Representation to the Parliament,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dated June 14 1647. they mention their Brethren of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>
as having proceeded in the vindication and defence of their
just rights and liberties, much higher then that Army hath
done; Wee are necessitated to say this much for clearing of
these proceedings in this Nation reflected upon: They of
this Church and Kingdom who joyned together and associated
themselves in this Cause, first by humble Petitions, and
afterwards by Covenant, were so far from slighting or breaking
that Covenant which was taken, that it was the special
visible character by which the friends of the Cause were
distinguished from the enemies thereof and they were so
far from crying down the Ministery and Ecclesiasticall Assemblies,
or from disobeying any Orders or Commands of
Parliament, that a Generall Assembly of the Church, and
a Parliament, were two chief Heads of their Petitions and
desires, at that time when they had neither; And when
they had obtained a Generall Assembly and Parliament,
they chearfully submitted to both respectively.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now the dangers of Religion in this Illand being so
great, as there hath been lately a Solemne Humilitation
throughout this Land, upon occasion of these great and
growing dangers; so we cannot but still look upon them as
matters of frequent Prayer and Humiliation to our selves,
as well as our Brethren in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, there being much
sin in both Kingdomes procuring all this evill, and justly
deserving these, and heavier judgements. And as wee
desire in the first place to be humbled for our own sins,
and the sins of this Nation, so we trust, our Brethren will
bee willing to be put in minde of the necessity of their Humiliation
and Repentance for the Nationall sins of the
Kingdome; which wee shall wish rather to be sadly considered
by them, then expressed by us. One thing wee
are confident of, that God hath had a speciall controversie
against his People of old for the sin of a broken Covenant,
and unwillingnesse to bee Reformed and Purged
according to the Word of the Lord; and that till their
sinnes were acknowledged and repented, his controversie
did not take an end.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And here is the wisdome and patience of the Saints,
to choose affliction rather then iniquity, to do duety in the
worst of times, and to trust God with events and in so doing,
to hope to the end and wait upon the Lord, untill hee plead
their cause and execute judgement for them: So shall
they bee more purified and not made blacker (as, alas,
some are) but whiter in times of tryall.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
More particularly, wee do desire that Presbyteriall Government
may be setled and put in practice through out that
Kingdom, according to the Word of God, and example
of the best Reformed Churches: for without this wee know
no other proper and effectuall remedy against the present
dangers of Religion there, or for purging the Church from
scandals, which are destructive either to sound Doctrine,
or to Godlinesse: And herein we are confident, the experience
of all the Reformed Churches will bear witnesse with
us. Nor do we doubt but in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> also, time and experience
will more and more commend, not only the beautifull
order, but the great utility, yea, necessity of this Government,
and dispell all the clouds of aspersions and prejudices
which it lieth under among such as know it not, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ought therefore to beware of speaking evill of the things
they understand not. Yet we would not have our zeal for
Presbyteriall Government mis-understood, as if it tended
to any rigour or domineering over the flock, or to hinder
and exclude that instructing in meeknesse them that oppose
themselves, which the Apostolicall rule holds forth; or
as if wee would have any such to bee intrusted with that
Government, as are found not yet purged, either from
their old profannesse, or from the Prelaticall principles
and practices which were but to put a piece of new cloath
unto an old garment, and so to make the rent worse; or
to put new wine into old bottles, and so to lose both wine
and bottles. Yea who knows whether this may not be one
of the causes, (and not the least) why the present Reformation
succeeds the worse, even because of so little repentance,
either for the profannesse, or Prelaticall errours
and corruptions of divers who have acted in it: Neverthelesse,
the right hand of fellowship is to bee given to all such
as bring forth fruits meet for repentance, whatsoever their
former errours of failings were. And to our great joy, we
understand that there are many learned, able, godly, and
prudent ministers in that Kingdome, fit to be imployed in
that government, together with such able and pious men,
as are to be joyned with them in the capacity of ruling Elders.
It shall be a part of our prayers, that the Lord of
the Harvest may send forth many more labourers in that
Kingdome, where the Harvest is so great and the Labourers
so few proportionably; and in the meane while, that such
as he hath already thrust out, may not be unemployed, as to
the point of discipline and Government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor lastly, doth our zeal for the Covenant and Presbyteriall
Government abate or diminish any thing at all from
our Loyalty and Duety to the Kings Majesty, although
Incendiaries and Enemies spare not to reproach this Church
and Kingdome with Disloyaltie: Yet such calumnies will
easily be repudiate by all who will examine the whole
course of the publike proceedings in this Nation, in reference
to the King, and particularly the Declaration of the
Parliament of this Kingdome, dated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">January 16. 1647</span></span>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherefore passing all such calumnies, whiche cannot but be
hatefull to God and good Men, wee do clearly and candidly
professe, That the Covenant and Presbyteriall Government
are so far from hindering or excluding our duety to the
King, that it is thereby very much strengthened and supported;
for our giving to God what is Gods doth not
hinder us, but help us, to give unto Cæsar what is Cæsars.
And wee earnestly wish his Majesties Royall Heart may bee
graciously inclined to the just desires of his good Subjects in
both Kingdomes, and to that happy settlement of Truth and
Peace, Religion and Righteousnesse, which may be as
well for the establishment of his own Throne, as for the
good of his people.

Now the Prince of Peace Himself, grant his afflicted
People, tossed with tempests and not comforted, a safe

unto all who are waiting for the consolation of Israel <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">good

way, that the understandings of the simpler may be the beter
enabled to profit under the publike Ordinances, and they
made more capable to understand the Scriptures when they
are read? Together with godly conferences tending to the
edification of all the members in the most holy faith: As also,
admonition and rebuke upon just reasons from these who
have Authority in the Familie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. As the Charge and Office of interpreting the holy
Scriptures, is a part of the Ministeriall calling, which none
(howsoever otherwise qualified) should take upon him in
any place, but he that is duely called thereunto by God and
his Kirk: So in every Familie where there is any that can
read, The holy Scriptures should be read ordinarily to the
Familie; And it is commendable that thereafter they confer,
and by way of conference make some good use of what hath
beene read and heard: As for example, if any sin be reproved
in the Word read, use may bee made thereof, to make all the
Familie circumspect and watchfull against the same; Or, if any
judgement be threatned or mentioned to have beene inflicted
in that Portion of Scripture which is read, use may bee
made to make all the Familie fear, lest the same or a worse
judgement befall them, unlesse they beware of the sin that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
procured it: And finally, if any duety be required, or comfort
held forth in a promise, use may bee made to stirre up
themselves to imploy Christ for strength to enable them for
doing the commanded duty, and to apply the offered comfort;
In all which the Master of the Familie is to have the
chief hand, And any member of the Familie may propone
ane question or doubt for resolution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. The head of the Family is to take care that none of
the Familie withdraw himself from any part of Familie
Worship: And seeing the ordinar performance of all the
parts of Family worship belongeth properly to the head of
the Family, The Minister is to stirre up such as are lasie,
and traine up such as are weak to a fitnesse for these exercises.
It being alwayes free to persons of qualitie to entertain
one approven by the Presbyterie for performing Familie
Exercise; And in other families where the head of the
Familie is unfit, that another constantly residing in
the Familie approven by the Minister and Session, may be
imployed in that service; Wherein the Minister and Session
are to be countable to the Presbyterie. And if a
Minister by divine providence bee brought to any Familie,
It is requisite, that at no time he conveen a part
of the Familie for Worship secluding the rest; Except
in singular cases, specially concerning these parties, which
(in Christian prudence) need not, or ought not to bee
imparted to others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. Let no Idler who hath no particular calling, or
vagrant Person under pretence of a calling, be suffered
to perform worship in Families, to or for the same: Seeing
persons tainted with errours or aiming at division, may
be ready (after that manner) to creep into houses
and lead captive silly and unstable souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. At Family Worship a speciall care is to be had,
that each Familie keep by themselves: Neither requiring,
inviting, nor admitting persons from divers Families;
Unlesse it be these who are lodged with them or at
meal, or otherwise with them upon some lawfull occasion.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. Whatsoever hath been the effects and fruits of
meetings of persons of divers Families in the times of
corruption or trouble (in which cases many things are commendable,
which otherwise are not tolerable), Yet when
God hath blessed us with Peace and the purity of the
Gospel, such meetings of persons of divers Families
(except in the cases mentioned in these Directions) are
to be disapproved, as tending to the hinderance of the
Religious exercise of each Familie by it self, to the prejudice
of the publike Ministery, to the renting of the Families
of particular Congregations, and (in progresse of
time) of the whole Kirk: besides many offences which may
come thereby, to the hardning of the hearts of carnall men,
and grief of the godly.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. On the Lords Day, after every one of the Family
apart, and the whole Family together have sought the
Lord (in whose hands the preparation of mens hearts are)
to fit them for the publicke Worship, and to blesse to them
the publike Ordinances; The Master of the Familie ought
to take care that all within his charge repair to the publike
Worship, that he and they may joyne with the rest of the
Congregation; And, the publike Worship being finished,
after prayer, he should take an account what they have heard,
And thereafter to spend the rest of the time which they
may spare, in Catechising and in spirituall conferences upon
the Word of God; Or else (going apart) they ought to
apply themselves to reading, meditation, and secret prayer,
that they may confirme and increase their Communion with
God; That so the profit which they found in the publike
Ordinances may bee cherished and promoved, and they
more edified unto eternall life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. So many as can conceive prayer; ought to make use
of that gift of God: Albeit these who are rude and weaker
may begin at a set form of prayer; But so, as they bee not
sluggish in stirring up in themselves (according to their
daily necessities) the spirit of prayer, which is given to all
the children of God in some measure. To which effect,
they ought to bee the more fervent and frequent in secret
prayer to God, for enabling of their hearts to conceive,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and their tongues to expresse convenient desires to God for
their Familie. And in the mean time, for their greater encouragement,
let these materialls of prayer be meditated
upon, and made use of, as followeth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let them confesse to God how unworthy they are to come
in his presence, and unfit to worship his Majesty; And
therefore earnestly ask of God the spirit of prayer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are to confesse their sins, and the sins of the Family
accusing, judging, and condemning themselves for them,
till they bring their souls to some measure of true humiliation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are to pour out their souls to God, in the Name of
Christ, by the spirit, for forgivinesse of sins, for Grace to
repent, to believe, and to live soberly, righteously, and
godly, and that they may serve God with joy and delight in
walking before him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are to give thanks to God for his many mercies to
his people, and to themselves, and especially for his love
in Christ, and for the light of the Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are to pray for such particular benefits, Spirituall
and Temporall, as they stand in need of for the time, (whether
it be Morning or Evening) as health or sicknesse, prosperitie
or adversitie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They ought to pray for the Kirk of Christ in general, for
all the Reformed Kirks, and for this Kirk in particular, and
for all that suffer for the Name of Christ for all our Superiours,
The Kings Majesty, the Queene, and their Children,
for the Magistrates, Ministers, and whole body of
the Congregation whereof they are members, as well for
their Neighbours absent in their lawfull affaires, as for those
that are at home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prayer may be closed with an earnest desire, that God
may be glorified in the comming of the Kingdome of his
Son, and in the doing of his wil; And with assurance that
themselves are accepted, and what they have asked according
to his will shall be done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
X. These exercises ought to be performed in great sinceritie
without delay, laying aside all Exercises of worldly
businesse or hinderances, Notwithstanding the mockings of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Atheists, and profane men; In respect of the great mercies
of God to this Land, and of his severe Corections wherewith
lately he hath exercised us. And to this effect,
persons of eminency (and all Elders of the Kirk) not onely
ought to stir up themselves and their Families to diligence
herein; But also to concurre effectually, that in all other
Families, where they have Power and Charge, the said
exercises be conscionably performed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XI. Besides the ordinary duties in Families which are
abovementioned, extraordinary duties both of humiliation
and thanksgiving are to bee carefully performed in Families,
when the Lord by extraordinary occasions (private or
publike) calleth for them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XII. Seeing the Word of God requireth, That wee
should consider one another to provoke unto love and good
works, Therefore, at all times, and specially in this time
wherein profanitie abounds, and mockers walking after
their own lusts think it strange that others run not with them
to the same excesse of riot, Every member of this Kirk ought to
stir up themselves and one another to the duties of mutuall
Edification, by instruction, admonition, rebuke, exhorting
one another to manifest the Grace of God, in denying
ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and in living godly, soberly,
and righteously in this present world, by comforting the
the feeble minded, and praying with, or, for one another;
Which duties respectively are to be performed upon speciall
occasions offered by divine providence; As namely, when
under any calamity, crosse, or great difficultie, counsel or
comfort is sought, Or when an offender is to bee reclaimed
by private admonition, and if that bee not effectuall, by joyning
one or two more in the admonition, according to the rule
of Christ; that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
word may be established.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIII. And because it is not given to every one to speak
a word in season to a wearied or distressed conscience, It is
expedint, that a person (in that case) finding no ease
after the use of all ordinary means private and publike, have
their addresse to their own Pastour, or some experienced
Christian, But, if the person troubled in conscience be of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that condition, or of that sex, that discretion, modestie
of fear of scandall, requireth a godly grave and secret friend
to be present with them in their said addresse, It is expedient
that such a friend be present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIV. When persons of divers Families are brought together
by divine providence, being abroad upon their particular
Vocations, or any necessary occasions, As they would
have the Lord their God with them whithersoever they go,
they ought to walk with God, and not neglect the duties of
Prayer and Thanksgiving, but take care that the same be
performed by such as the company shall judge fittest: And
that they likewise take heed that no corrupt communication
proceed out of their mouth, but that which is good, to the
use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The drift and scope of all these Directions is no other, but
that upon the one part, the power and practice of godlinesse
among all the Ministers and Members of this Kirk, according
to their severall places and vocations, may be cherished
and advanced, and all impietie and mocking of Religious
Exercises suppressed; And upon the other part, that under
the name and pretext of Religious Exercises; no such
meetings or practices be allowed, as are apt to breed Error,
Scandall, Schisme, contempt or mis-regard of the
publike Ordinances and Ministers, or neglect of the duties
of particular Callings, or such other evils as are the works
not of the Spirit but of the Flesh, and are contrary to Truth
and Peace.

Since it hath pleased God of his infinite goodnesse to blesse
his Kirk within this Nation, with the riches of the Gospel,
in giving to us his Ordinances in great purity, liberty,
and withall, a comely and well-established order: The
Assembly, in the zeal of God, for preserving Order, Unitie
and Peace in the Kirk, for maintaining the respect which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is due to the Ordinances and Ministers of Jesus Christ, for
preventing Schisme, noisome Errours, and all unlawfull
Practices, which may follow on the Peoples withdrawing
themselves from their own Congregations, Doth charge every
Minister to bee diligent in fulfilling his Ministerie, to be
holy and grave in his conversation, to be faithfull in Preaching,
declaring the whole counsell of God, and as he hath occasion
from the Text of Scripture to reprove the sins and errours,
and presse the duties of the time; and in all those, to
observe the rules prescribed by the Acts of Assembly; wherein
if he be negligent, he is to be censured by his own Presbytery.
As also Ordains every Member in every Congregation
to keep their own Paroch Kirk, to communicate there
in the Word and Sacraments; And if any person or Persons
shall hereafter usually absent themselves from their own Congregations,
except in urgent cases made known to, and approven
by the Presbytery, The Ministers of these Congregations
whereto they resort, shall both in publike by Preching,
and in private admonition, shew their dislike of their
withdrawing from their own Minister; That in so doing,
they may witnesse to all that heare them, their due care to
Strengthen the hands of their fellow labourers in the work
of the Lord, and their detestation of any thing that may tend
to separation, or any of the abovementioned evils; Hereby
their own Flock will be confirmed in their stedfastnesse, and
the unstable spirits of others will be rectified. Likeas the
Minister of that Congregation from which they do withdraw,
shall labour first by private admonition to reclaim
them; And if any after private admonition given by their
own Pastour do not amend, in that case the Pastour shall delate
the foresaid persons to the Session, who shall cite and
censure them as contemners of the comely order of the
Kirk; And if the matter be not taken order with there, It is
to bee brought to the Presbytery: For the better observing
whereof, the Presbyteries at the Visitation of their severall
Kirks, and Provincial Assemblies, in their censure of the several
Presbyteries, shall enquire hereanent: Which inquirie
and report shall be registrate in the Provincial Books, that
their diligence may be seen in the General Assembly.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Confession of Faith for the Kirks of God in the three
Kingdomes, being the chiefest part of that Uniformity
in Religion which by the solemne League and Covenant we
are bound to endeavour; And there being accordingly a
Confession of Faith agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines
sitting at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westminster</span></span>, with the assistance of Commissioners
from the Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>; Which Confession was
sent from our Commissioners at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span> to the Commissioners
of the Kirk met at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh</span></span>
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">January</span></span> last, hath been in
this Assembly twice publikely read over, examined and
considered; Copies thereof being also Printed, that it
might be particularly perused by all the Members of this
Assembly, unto whom frequent intimation was publikely
made, to put in their doubts and objections if they
had any; And the said Confession being upon due examination
thereof found by the Assembly to bee most agreable
to the Word of God, and in nothing contrary
to the received Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, and Government
of this Kirk. And lastly, it being so necesary
and so much longed for, That the said Confession be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with all possible diligence and expedition approved and established
in both Kingdoms, as a principal part of the intended
Uniformity in Religion, and as a special means for
the more effectual suppressing of the many dangerous errours
and heresies of these times; The General Assembly doth
therefore after mature diliberation agree unto and approve
the said Confession as to the truth of the matter (judging it
to be most orthodox and grounded upon the Word of God)
and also as to the point of Uniformity. Agreeing for our
part that it be a common Confession of Faith for the three
Kingdomes. The Assembly doth also blesse the Lord; and
thankfully acknowledge his great mercy, in that so excellent
a Confession of Faith is prepared, and thus far agreed
upon in both Kingdomes; which we look upon as a great
strengthning of the true Reformed Religion against the common
enemies thereof. But lest our intention and meaning
be in some particulars misunderstood, It is hereby expresly
Declared and Provided, that the not mentioning in this
Confession the several sort of Ecclesiastical Officers and Assemblies,
shall be no prejudice to the Truth of Christ in
these particulars to be expressed fully in the Directory of
Government. It is further Declared, that the Assembly understandeth
some parts of the second Article of the thirty one
Chapter, only of Kirks not settled or constituted in point
of Government, And that although in such Kirks, a Synod
of Ministerrs and other fit persons may be called by the Magistrates
authority and nomination without any other Call,
to consult and advise with about matters of Religion; And
although likewise the Ministers of Christ without delegation
from their Churches, may of themselves, and by vertue
of their Office meet together Synodically in such Kirks
not yet constituted; Yet neither of these ought to be done
in Kirks constituted and setled: It being always free to the
Magistrate to advise with Synods of Ministers and ruling Elders
meeting upon delegation from their Churches, either
ordinarly, or being indicted by his Authority occasionally
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro re nata</span></span>; It being also free to assemble together
Synodically, as well <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro re nata</span></span>, as at the ordinary times upon
delegation from the Churches, by the intrinsical power received
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from Christ, as often as it is necessary for the good of the
Church so to assemble, in case the Magistrate to the detriment
of the Church withhold or deny his consent, the necessity
of occasionall Assemblies being first remonstrate unto
him by humble supplication.

Although this Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, whiles spoiled of her Liberties
under the Prelatical tyrannie, had much difficultie

and wrestling to preserve the true reformed Religion

the mighty &amp; out-stretched arme of the Lord our God hath
brought us out of that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Egypt</span></span>, and hath restored to us well
constituted and free national Synods, It hath been our desire
and endeavour to set forward the Kingdom of our Lord
Jesus Christ and the purity of his Ordinances, not only
throughout this Nation, but in other parts also so far as God
gave us a call and opportunity and opened a way unto us. And
among other things of this nature we have more particularly
taken into our serious thoughts the sad and lamentable
condition of many thousands of you our Country-men who
are scattered abroad as sheepe having no shepherd, and are
through the want of the meanes of knowledge grace and
salvation, exposed to the greatest spirituall dangers, whether
through ignorance or through manifold tentations to errors
and false Religions, or through the occasions and snares of
sinne.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wee have therefore thought it incumbent to us to put you
in minde of the one thing necessary, while you are so carefull
and troubled about the things of the world. And although
we do not disallow your going abroad to follow any
lawfull calling or way of lively hood, yet seeing it cannot
profit a man although he should gain the whole world and
lose his own soul, and seeing you have travelled so farre,
and taken so much pains to get uncertain riches which cannot
deliver in the day of the wrath of the Lord, and which men
know not who shall inherit; We doe from our affection
to the salvation of your immortall souls most earnestly beseech
and warn you to cry after knowledge and lift up your
voyce for understanding, seeking her as silver, and searching
for her as for hid treasures, and so play the wise Merchants
in purchasing the Pearl of Price, and in laying up a sure
foundation for the time to come, by acquainting your souls
with Jesus Christ, and by faith taking hold of him whose
free grace is now offered and held out to sinners, excluding
none among all the kindreds of the earth who will
come unto him. God forbid that you should let slip the time

and offers of grace, or neglect any warning of this kinde sent
to you in the name of the Lord. We shall hope better things
of you, and that knowing the acceptable time and the day
of salvation will not alwayes last, but the Lord Jesus is to
be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming
fire taking vengeance on them that know not God and
obey not the Gospel, you will the rather bestirre your selves
timely and with all diligence to seek the Lord while
he may bee found, to endeavour that you may have among
you the ordinary means of grace and salvation, to pray that
God would give you Pastors according to his heart, who
shall feede you with knowledge and understanding, to consult
also and agree among your selves with consent of your
Superiors under whom you live (whose favour and good
will we trust will not be wanting to you in so good and necessary
a work) for setting up the worship of God and Ecclesiasticall
Discipline among you according to the form
established and received in this your mother Kirk, and for a
way of settled maintenance to Pastors and Teachers, Which
if you do, our Commissioners appointed to meet from time
to time in the intervall betwixt this and the next Nationall
Assembly, will bee ready (upon your desire made known
to them) to provide some able and godly Ministers for you,

upon these considerations, having heard publikely read
the CXI following Propositions exhibited
and tendered by some Brethren, who were
appointed to prepare Articles or Propositions
for the vindication of the Trueth in these
particulars, Doth unanimously approve &amp;
agree unto these eight generall Heads of Doctrine
therein contained and asserted, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> 1. That the Ministery
of the Word and the Administration of the Sacraments
of the New Testament, Baptisme and the Lords Supper,
are standing Ordinances instituted by God himself to
continue in the Church to the end of the World. 2. That
such as Administer the Word and Sacraments, ought to be
duely called and ordained thereunto. 3. That some Ecclesiasticall
censures are proper and peculiar to be inflicted onely
upon such as bear Office in the Kirk; Other censures are
common and may bee inflicted both on Ministers and other
Members of the Kirk. 4. That the censure of suspension
from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, inflicted because
of grosse ignorance, or because of a scandalous life and conversation,
As likewise the censure of Excommunication or
calling out of the Kirk flagitious or contumacious offenders,
both the one censure and the other is warranteble by and
grounded upon the Word of God, and is necessary (in respect
of divine institution) to be in the Kirk. 5. That as
the Rights, Power, and Authority of the Civill Magistrate
are to bee maintained according to the Word of God, and
the Confessions of the Faith of the Reformed Kirks; So it
is no lesse true and certaine, that Jesus Christ, the onely
Head and onely King of the Kirk, hath instituted and appointed
a Kirk Government distinct from the Civill Government
or Magistracie. 6: That the Ecclesiastical Government
is committed and intrusted by Christ to the Assemblies of
the Kirk, made up of the Ministers of the Word and Ruling
Elders. 7. That the lesser and inferiour Ecclesiasticall
Assemblies, ought to bee subordinate and subject unto the
greater and superiour Assemblies. 8. That notwithstanding
hereof, the Civill Magistrate may and ought to
suppresse by corporall or Civill punishments, such as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by spreading Errour or Heresie, or by fomenting Schisme
greatly dishonour God, dangerously hurt Religeon and disturbe
the Peace of the Kirk. Which Heads of Doctrine
(howsoever opposed by the authors and fomenters of the
foresaid errours respectively) the Generall Assembly doth
firmely beleeve, own, maintaine, and commend unto
others, as Solide, True, Orthodoxe, grounded upon the
Word of God, consonant to the judgement both of the ancient
and the best Reformed Kirk; And because this Assembly
(through the multitude of other necessary and pressing
bussinesse) cannot now have so much leisure, as to examine
and consider particularly the foresaid CXI. Propositions;
Therefore, a more particular examination thereof
is committed and referred to the Theologicall faculties in
the four Universities of this Kingdome, and the judgement
of each of these faculties concerning the same, is appointed
to bee reported to the next Generall Assembly. In the
meane while, these Propositions shall bee Printed, both
that Copies thereof may bee sent to Presbyteries, and that
it may be free for any that pleaseth to peruse them, and to
make known or send their judgement concerning the same to

the Committee of Estates of the 24. July.</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Generall Assembly having considered the Paper of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">24. July</span></span> delivered to them from the conference, and
having compared it with the other Paper of the 17. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July</span></span>
presented from the Honourable Committee of Estates whereunto
it relates, and with the Declaration lately emitted
by the Committee to the Parliament and Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>,
finde that it is supposed by their Lordships, that we
may be satisfied in point of the security of Religion according
to the Covenant; notwithstanding of the present engagement
in war; The Assembly do therefore in answer to the
said Paper declare,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
That we see no possibility of securing Religion, as long as
this unlawfull Engagement is carried on, Religion being
thereby greatly endangered,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Because none of the just and necessary desires of the
Commission of the late General Assembly for securing Religion
have been granted or satisfied; More particularly it was
represented to the High and Honourable Court of Parliament,
that for securing of Religion, it was necessary that
the Popish, Prelaticall and Malignant party, be declared
Enemies to the Cause upon the one hand, as well as Sectaries
upon the other, and that all Associations, either in
Forces or Councels with the former as well as the latter be
avoided. That his Majesties Concessions and offers concerning
Religion, sent home from the Isle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wight</span></span>, be declared
by the Parliament to be unsatisfactory, That before his
Majesties restitution to the exercise of his Royall power assurance
be had from his Majesty by his solemn Oath under his
hand and Seal for settling Religion according to the Covenant,
That their Lordships should keep themselves from
owning any quarrel concerning his Majesties Negative voice,
That the managing of the publike affairs, might be intrusted
onely to such persons as have given constant proof of their
integrity, and against whom there is no just cause of exception
or jealousie, and that there might be no Engagement
without a solemn Oath, wherein the Kirk ought to hand
the same interest they had in the solemn League and Covenant;
All which are more particularly expressed in the Papers
given in by the Commission of the late Assembly to the
Parliament; notwithstanding the Engagement hath been
carried on without satisfaction to these and the like desires,
and so without giving security in the point of Religion, but
with great and manifest danger to the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. As the happy Union of the Kingdoms, by the solemn
League and Covenant hath been justly looked upon as a speciall
means for preserving and strengthening the true Reformed
Religion in this Island, So it is no lesse weakened &amp;
hurt by endeavouring a breach between these Kingdoms;
Which howsoever disclaimed, is yet manifest from the reality
of the publike proceedings in this Engagement, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
namely from the neglect of endeavouring a Treaty between
the Kingdoms for preventing of War and bloodshed as was
earnestly desired, from their associating and joyning with
known Malignants and Incendiaries, and such as have been
declared Enemies to this Cause, from their entring the Kingdom
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> with an Army, upon the grounds of the Declaration
of the Parliament, which cannot but infer a National
quarrel against the Parliament and Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and
from their garrisoning the frontire Towns of that Kingdom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Engagement is carried on by such means and
ways, as tend to the destroying of Religion, by ensnaring
and forcing the consciences of the people of God with unlawfull
Bands and Oathes, and oppressing the Persons and
Estates of such as have been most active and zealous for Religion
and the Covenant. All which is strengthened and authorized
by Acts of Parliament, appointing that all that do
not obey, or perswade others not to obey the Resolutions
of Parliament and Committee anent this Engagement, or
who shall not subscribe the Act and Declaration of the 10.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span>, 1648. imposed upon all the Subjects, shall be holden
as enemies to the Cause and to Religion, and have their
persons secured, and their Estates intromitted with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. The Engagement is carried on, not without great encroachments
upon the Liberties of the Kirk, as we are ready
to clear in many particulars.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherefore the security of Religion, and carrying on of
the present Engagement being inconsistent, We do propose
for the necessary security and safety of Religion, that
all the dangers thereof may be taken to consideration, and
amongst the rest the said Engagement as one of the greatest
which yet being established and authorized by Act of Parliament,
we leave it to their Lordships to think of what
remedies may be provided for redressing grievances which
flow from such Acts and Ordinances. This we are sure of,
the publike desires of the Kirk will abundantly witnesse
for us, that such things as were necessary for the security
of Religion, were in due season represented, &amp; yet not
granted by them that had greater power &amp; authority at that
time when it was much more easie to give satisfaction therein
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then now; So that the blame cannot lye upon the General
Assembly or their Commissioners that Religion is not secured.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Generall Assembly taking to consideration a Declaration
and Act of Parliament, of the date 10. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span>,
1648. highly concerning Religion, and the consciences of
the People of God in the Land, and one Act of the Committee
of Estates, of the date 12. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span>, 1648. both published
in Print, whereby all Subjects are Ordained by subscription
to acknowledge as just, and oblige themselves to
adhere unto the said Act and Declaration, containing an
obligation upon their honours and credits, and as they desire
to be, and to be holden, as lovers of their Country,
Religion, Laws and Liberties, to joyn and concur with
their Persons and Estates in the assistance of the execution,
and observation of the Acts and Constitutions of this Parliament,
as the most fit and necessary remedies of the by-gone
and present evils and distractions of this Kirk and Kingdom,
and for the preservation of Religion, Laws and Liberties
and of his Majesties authority, with certification that such
as refuse or delay to subscribe the same, shall be holden as
Enemies and Opposites to the Common Cause, consisting
in the maintenance of the true reformed Religion, of the
Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom and of his Majesties authority.
Which subscription the Assembly cannot otherwise
look upon, then as a snare for the People of God to
involve them in guiltinesse, and to draw them from their
former Principles and Vows in the solemn League and Covenant.
For that subscription were an approving of some
Acts of Parliament, which they have never yet seen nor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
known, they not being all published, were an agreeing to
Acts of Parliament, highly concerning Religion and the
Covenant, made not onely without, but expresly against the
advise of the Kirk, were an acknowledging of this present
Engagement in War, in all the means and ways for promoving
the same, to be the most fit and necessary remedies of
the by-gone and present evils, whereas so many Petitions to
the Parliament, from Committees of War, Synods, Presbyteries
and Paroches have made it appear, that they are no
way satisfied therewith in point of conscience; were an
ascribing of a power to the Parliament, to declare these to
be enemies to the true Religion, whom the Kirk hath not
declared to be such but rather friends; were an approving
of an Act made for the restraining the liberty of printing
from the Kirk, yea and of all the Acts of the Committee of
Estates, to be made in time coming, till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span> 1650. which
by Act of Parliament are ordained to be obeyed; were an
allowing of Acts for securing of the persons, and intrometting
with the Estates of such as themselves shall not obey, or
perswade others not to obey resolutions concerning this Engagement,
and for protecting persons under Kirk Censures,
and so an infringing and violating of the Liberties and Discipline
of the Kirk established by the Laws of the Land,
and sworn to in the Nationall Covenant to be defended,
under the pains contained in the Law of God, And in all
these, such as do subscribe, do binde themselves not only
to active obedience in their own persons, but to the urging
of active obedience upon all others, and so draw upon
themselves all the guiltinesse and sad consequences of the
present engagement; Yea, such as are Members of Parliament,
and have in the Oath of Parliament sworn not to Vote
or consent to any thing, but what to their best knowledge
is most expedient for Religion, Kirk and Kingdom, and
accordingly have reasoned against, and dissented from divers
Acts of this Parliament, These by the subscription of this
Act, cannot eschew the danger of perjury, in obliging
themselves to active obedience to these Acts, which according
to their Oath, they did judge unlawfull. Neither can
the 38. Act of the Parliament 1640. wherein such a kinde of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Band was enacted to be subscribed by any precedent or Warrant
for subscribing of this Act; For it plainly appears by the
narrative of that Act omitted in this Band, how great a difference
there is between the condition of affairs then &amp; now.
Then the Kings Commissioner had left and discharged the sitting
of the Parl. then the Parl. for sitting was declared Traitors,
and Armies in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> prepared against them,
then not only the Act, but the very authority of Parliament
was called in question, then Kirk and State were united in
the Cause against the Malignant party, then nothing was
determined in Parliament in matters of Religion without,
much lesse against the advice of the Kirk; But beside that, it
was not thought expedient by the State, that that Band should
be pressed through the Kingdom. The case now not onely
differs from what was then, But is in many things just contrary,
as is evident to all who will compare the two together.
And therefore the Generall Assembly professing in all tender
respect to the high and Honourable Court of Parliament and
Committee of Estates, but finding a straiter tye of God lying
upon their Consciences, that they be not found unfaithfull
watchmen, and betrayers of the souls of these committed to
their charge, Do unanimously Declare the foresaid subscription
to be unlawfull and sinfull. And do warn, and In the
Name of the Lord Charge all the members of this Kirk, to
forbear the subscribing of the said Act and Declaration, much
more the urging of the subscription thereof, as they would
not incur the wrath of God, and the Censures of the Kirk.
And considering how necessary it is that according to the
desire of the Commissioners of the Assembly to the
Parliament, the Kirk might have the same interest in
any new Oathes in this Cause, as they had in the solemn
League and Covenant, and what dangers of contradictory
Oathes, perjuries and snares to mens consciences
may fall out otherwise: Therefore they likewise enjoyn
all the members of this Kirk, to forbear the swearing, subscribing
or pressing of any new Oathes or Bands in this Cause,
without advice and concurrence of the Kirk, especially
to in any way limit or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
restrain them in the duties whereunto they are obliged, by
nationall or solemn League and Covenant, and that with
certification as aforesaid. And such as have already pressed
or subscribed the foresaid Act and Declaration, The Generall
Assembly doth hereby exhort them most earnestly in the
bowels of Christ, to repent of that their defection. And
Ordains that Presbyteries, or in case of their negligence,
or being overawed the provinciall Synods or the Commission
of the Assembly, which of them shall first occur, and
in case of the Synods negligence, that the said Commission
be carefull to proceed against, and censure the contraveeners
of the Act according to the quality and degree of their offences
as they will be answerable to the Generall Assembly;
and that therefore this Act be sent to Presbyteries to be
republished in the several Kirks of their bounds.

against whose cursed opinions and ungodly practises, we have
heretofore given ample testimony, and are still obliged by
Solemn Covenant to endeavour the extirpation of Heresie
and Schism; But from the Conscience or our duty when
the glory of God, the Kingdom of his Son, his Word,
Ordinances, Government, Covenant, Ministery, Consciences
of People, Peace and Liberties of the Kirk are incompassed
and almost overwhelmed with great and growing
dangers.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How freely and faithfully the servants of God of old have
rebuked sin in persons of all ranks, not sparing Kings, States
nor Kingdoms, the Scripture maketh it most plain to all
that looks thereon; Neither want we domestick examples,
if we look back a little upon the behaviour of our zealous
Ancestours in this Kirk, who not only in their Sermons severally
with great gravity and freedom reproved the sins of
the time, But more especially in the Kirk Judicatories plain
and downright dealing was most frequent and familiar, as
appears in the Assemblies holden in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June</span></span>
and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">October</span></span> 1582.
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">October</span></span> 1583. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May</span></span>
1592. in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May</span></span> 1594. and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span>
1595. And not only the Generall Assembly by themselves,
but also by their Commissioners faithfully and freely laboured
to oppose all the steps of defection; as at other times,
so in the yeer 1596. wherein four or five severall times they
gave most free admonitions to the King, Parliament and
Councell, with a Protestation at the last before God, that
they were free of their blood, and of whatsoever judgement
should fall upon the Realm, and that they durst not for
fear of committing High Treason against Jesus Christ the
onely Monarch of his Kirk, abstain any longer from fighting
against their proceedings with the spiritual armour granted
to them of God, and mighty in him for overthrowing
all these bulwarks set up against his Kingdom; And in their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Declaration then emitted to the Kingdom, they shew that
it was a main design to have the freedom of the Spirit of God
in the rebuke of Sin by the mouthe of his Servants restrained
and therefore they warne all Pastours of their duty in applying
Doctrine and free preaching. Like as the Assembly,
24. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span> 1596, reckons up amongst the corruptions of the
Ministery to be censured with deprivation, if continued in,
the not applying their Doctrine against the corruptions of
the time, which was renewed in our late Assembly at
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span> 1638. What hath been done since that Assembly is
in recent memory; and the Papers to that purpose have been
published in Print, and are in the hands of all, Therefore
being warranted by the Word of God, and encouraged by
the forementioned examples, as after exact examination,
we have approven the proceedings of the Commissioners of
the last Generall Assembly, and specially their Declarations,
Desires, Representatations, Remonstrances, Supplications,
Vindication and other Papers relating to the present
engagment in War, wherein they have given good proof of
their fidelity, wisdom and zeal in the cause of God, So we
finde our selves necessitate to make known unto all the People
of God in this Nation our sense concerning the dangers
and duties or this present time.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The cry of the insolencies of this present Army from almost
all the parts of this Kingdom, hath been so great that
it hath gone up to heaven, and if we should be silent, we
could not be reputed faithfull in the performance of our
duty. We do acknowledge that it is incident unto all Armies
to be subject unto some disorders, and the Ministers of
the Kingdom have not been deficient in former times to represent
the same as they come unto their knowledge, calling
for the redresse of them at their hands who had power: But
the Commissioners of this present Assembly from the severall
Provinces have exhibited great variety or abominable scandals
and heinous impieties and insolencies committed by
persons imployed in this service, whereof we think fitting
here to give you a touch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As if liberty had been proclaimed to the lusts of lewd men,
These that have been imployed in very many places of Land
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have used horrible extortion of Moneys at their pleasure,
and beside the taking of victuals as they would for their
own use, they have in severall places wilfully destroyed
the same, and have plundred many houses, taking all away
they could and destroying what they could not carry away; in
this great oppression &amp; spoil of goods as the sufferers were many
so choise hath been made of those who Petitioned the High
and Honourable Court of Parliament for satisfaction to their
Consciences before the Engagement, or who were known
to make conscience of the worship of God in their families,
on whom they might exercise their raging wrath and unsatiable
convetousnesse; Nor stayed their rage here, but as
though the war had been against God, publick Fasts have
not only been neglected, but profaned by riotous spending
and making merry, Divine Worship have been in many
parts disturbed, some Ministers and people impeded from
coming together, others scattered when they were met,
some taken out of Kirks in time of worship, others apprehended
at their coming out at the Kirk doors and carryed
away; Besides these Ministers in performing the worship of
God have been menaced, contradicted, not without blasphemous
Oathes, yea their persons in Pulpit assaulted, not
to speak of the spoiling of their goods, taking, beating,
carrying away their persons and detaining them for a time.
And finally that which excedes all the rest and is more immediately
and directly against God, there hath also been many
cruell mockings of his Worship, and horrid blasphemies;
And it is not to be marvelled that such insolencies have been
committed, since there hath been admitied upon this service
some Papists, some bloody Irish Rebels, some non Covenanters,
and very many fugitives from Kirk Discipline,
Finally, even those who have been upon the late Rebellion,
and these not onely common Souldiers but Commanders, beside
many voluntiers who have no speciall command &amp; trust.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides all these, the Liberties of the Kirk have been grievously
encroached upon; 1. By emitting Declarations from
the Parliament and Committee of Estates, containing
severall things highly concerning Religion without the advice
or consent of the Generall Assembly or their Commissioners,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which was a ground of protestation to divers Members
of Parliament who have been most zealous and active in
the Cause. 2. The Article of Religion as expressed in the
Declaration of Parliament hath in it many dangerous expressions,
which are particularly instanced in the Representation
of the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly; And the
same Article of Religion in the late Declaration of the
Committee of Estates to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> is more unsatisfactory then
the former: Like as in the said late Declaration there is a
totall omission of some most materiall things pretended to in
the Declaration of Parliament as satisfactory in point of securing
Religion, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> the clause concerning security to be
had from his Majesty by his solemn Oath under his hand and
Seal, that he shall for himself and his Successors give his
Royall assent, and agree to such Act or Acts of Parliament,
and Bills as shall be presented to him by his Parliaments of
both and either Kingdoms respectively for enjoyning Presbyteriall
Government, Directory of Worship and Confession
of Faith in all his Majesties Dominions, and that his
Majestie shall never make opposition to any of those, nor
endeavour any change thereof; also the clause against association
with any that refuse to take the Covenant is omitted:
From all which it may appear in how great danger the liberties
of the Kirk and even Religion it self are left. 3. In the
close of the Declaration of Parliament, there is a new and
unsound glosse put upon the Covenant and Acts of General
Assembly, contrary to the sense of the General Assembly
itself, as is more fully expressed in the Representation of
the late Commission. 4. No redresse by the Parliament of
certain injuries complained of to their Lordships by the
Commissioners of the preceeding Generall Assembly.
5. Endeavours to weaken and frustrate Kirk-Censures by
making provisions for securing the stipends of such as shall
be censured for their concurring in, or preaching for this
present Engagement. 6. A misrepresentation of the proceedings
of the Commission of the Generall Assembly by
the Parliaments Letter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">May</span></span> 11. to the severall Presbyteries,
endeavouring to incense them against the Commission
of the late Assembly and to pre-ocupie their Commissioners
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to this Assembly. 7. Whereas there were many
Petitions presented to the High and Honourable Court
of Parliament from the Commissioners of the General Assembly,
Synods &amp; Presbyteries against the present Engagement
as stated in the Parliaments Declaration, yet notwithstanding
of the said Petitions, and notwithstanding of many
free &amp; frequent warnings given by faithful Ministers in their
Sermons, notwithstanding also that it was not unknown
how much the generality of the wel affected in the Kingdom
were unsatisfied in their consciences with the grounds and
way of the said Engagement, yet good people are not onely
left unsatisfied in their and our desires, but compelled and
forced either to sin against their consciences or to be under
heavy pressures &amp; burdens. 8. Yea in the late Band injoyned
to be subscribed by all the Subjects of this Kingdom, men are
put to it to joyn and concur with their Persons &amp; Estates, in
the advancement, furtherance and assistance of the execution
obedience &amp; observation of the Acts and constitutions of the
late Parliament; &amp; consequently, as many as think the Engagement
unlawful shall bind themselves not onely for their
own part against their consciences, but to inforce the same
upon others who refuse, and so not onely be oppressed,
but turn oppressours of others. 9. This all the subjects
are required by the Act and Declaration of Parliament to
subscribe, as they desire to be holden true lovers of Religion;
It being further affirmed in the said Act and Declaration,
that the Acts and Constitutions of the late Parliament,
are the most fit and necessary remedies for preservation
of Religion; Where the Parliament assume to themselves,
without the advice and consent of the Assemblies
of the Kirk, to judge and determine such things wherein,
(if in any thing) the ecclesiastical Assemblies have undoubtedly
a special interest, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span> who are to be holden lovers
of Religion, and what are the most fit and necessary
remedies for preservation of Religion: Yea it is ordained
by the fourth Act of Parliament, 1640. that for preservation
of Religion, G. Assemblies rightly constitute, as the
proper &amp; competent judge of all matters Ecclesiastical, be
keeped yearly and oftner <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro re nata</span></span>. The Coronation Oath
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg 386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
doth also suppose the antecedent Judgement of the Kirk, as
the proper and competent judge who are enemies to true
Religion &amp; who not; for his Majesty obliged himself by that
Oath, that he should be carefull to root out all Hereticks
and enemies to the true Worship of God, who shall be
convict by the true Kirk of God, of the aforesaid crimes.
10. The General Assembly and their Commissioners are now
deprived of their liberty of Printing, confirmed and ratified
by Act of Parliament, there being an inhibition to the contrary
upon the PRINTER, under the pain of Death
by the Committee of Estates.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whereas the desires of the Commissioners of the last Assembly,
for the safety and security of Religion, and the
right manner of proceeding to war, together with the supplications
of Provinciall Assemblies and Presbyteries, all
tending to the composing of the present unhappy differences,
and to the begetting of a right understanding, have
not produced the desired and wished-for effect; but on the
contrary our just grievances being still more and more
heightned, iniquity established by a law; and that law put
in execution; We cannot chuse but declare and give warning
to all the people of GOD in this land, concerning the
sinfulnesse and unlawfulnesse of the present Engagement:
which may be demonstrate by many reasons, as namely.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The Wars of GODS people, are called the Wars of
the LORD, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Numb.</span></span> 21,
14. 2 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chron</span></span> 20. 15. and if our
eating and drinking, much more our engaging in war must
be for God and for his glory; 1 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cor.</span></span> 10. 31. whatsoever we
do in word or deed, we are commanded to do all in the name
of the Lord Jesus, and so for his glory, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Col.</span></span> 3. 17. The
Kingdom of GOD and the righteousnesse thereof is to
be sought in the first place and before all other things,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matth.</span></span> 6. 33. It was the best flower and garland in the
former expeditions of this Nation, that they were for God
and for Religion principally and mainly. But if the principal
end of this present Engagement were for the glory of
GOD, How comes it to passe that not so much as one of the
desires of the Kirk, for the safety and security of Religion in
the said Engagement, is to this day satisfied or granted; But
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387" id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on the contrary such courses taken as are destructive to Religion.
And if Gods glory be intended what meaneth the
employing and protecting in this Army so many blasphemers
persecutors of Piety, disturbers of divine worship, and
others guilty of notorious and crying sins. Again, how
can it be pretended that the good of Religion is principally
aimed at, when it is proposed and declared that the Kings
Majestie shall be brought to some of his houses in or near <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>,
with Honour, Freedom and Safety, before ever
there be any security had from him, or so much as any application
made to him for the good of Religion. What is
this but to postpone the honour of God, the liberties of the
Gospel, the safety of Gods people to an humane interest,
and to leave Religion in a condition of uncertainty, unsetlednesse
and hazard, while it is strongly endeavoured to settle
and make sure somewhat else.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Suppose the ends of this Engagement to be good
(which they are not) yet the meanes and ways of prosecution
are unlawfull, because there is no ane equall avoiding
of rocks on both hands, but a joyning with malignants to
suppresse Sectaries, a joyning hands with a black devill to
beat a white devil; They are bad Physicians who would so
cure one disease as to breed another as evil; or worse. That
there is in the present Engagement a confederacy and association
in war with such of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">English</span></span> who according to the
solemn League and Covenant and Declarations of both
Kingdoms, 1643. can be no otherwise looked upon but
as Malignants and enemies of Reformation and the Cause
of God, is now made so manifest before Sun and Moon,
that we suppose none will deny it; And tis no lesse undeniable,
that not only many known Malignants, but diverse
who joyned in the late rebellion within this Kingdom are
employed, yea, put into places of trust; All which how contrary
tis to the Word of God, no man can be ignorant who
will attentively search the Scriptures, for we finde therein
condemned confederacies and associations with the enemies
of true Religion, whether <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canaanites</span></span>,

with them as confederates and associates, especially in a
cause where Religion is so highly concerned; and seeing
they have been formerly in actuall opposition to the same
cause.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. We are commanded if it be possible and as much as
lieth in us to have peace with all men, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rom.</span></span> 12. 18, to seek
peace and pursue it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Psal.</span></span> 34. 14. war and bloodshed is the
last remedy after all the wayes and means of peace have been
used in vain. The intended war of the nine Tribes and a
half against the two Tribes and half was prevented by a
Message and Treaty of Peace <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Josh.</span></span> 22; The like means
was used by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jepthah</span></span> (though not with the like success)

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ammon</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judg.</span></span> 11.
The very light of nature hath taught Heathens not to make
war till first all amicable wayes of preventing bloodshed
were tried; yet this war hath been driven on without observing
any such method of proceeding except by a message
wherein not so much as one breach was represented. Yea
though these two Kingdoms are straitly united in Covenant,
yet these who have carried on this war did not only neglect
to desire a Treaty, but also slight an offer of a Treaty made
from the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> upon the Propositions of
both Kingdoms.

therefore the present Engagement be a breach of our solemn League and Covenant,
then they who have before taken the Covenant,
and have now joyned in this Engagement, must grant by
necessary and infailible consequence, either that the Covenant
it self which they took was unlawful, and such as they
cannot perform without sin (which yet they cannot professe)
or otherwise, that the Engagement is unlawfull and
sinfull, as being a breach of Covenant, and so contrary to
the Word of God; that the present Engagement is a breach
of Covenant may appear by comparing it with each of the
Articles, for it is against all the six Articles of the Covenant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Against the first, because in stead of the preservation of
the Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government of this
Kirk; there is not onely a great quarelling by those that do
Engage, at the present doctrine, and free preaching, a
disturbing of and withdrawing from the Worship, and namely
from the late solemn humiliation: But also a refusall
of such things as were desired by the Commission of the
late Assembly and Provincial Synods, as necessary to the preservation
of the true Reformed Religion: And we have just
cause of fear that the Reformation of Religion in Doctrine,
Worship, Discipline and Government is not intended
to be sufficiently maintained and preserved, when we
finde such a limitation and restriction in the late Declaration
of the Committee of Estates to the Parliament and Kingdom
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England, That they will maintain and preserve the
Reformation of Religion, Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and Government,
as is by the mercy of GOD, and his Majesties goodnesse
established by Law among us</span></span>; but as there is no such
limitation in the Covenant, so we have not had such proof
of his Majesties goodnesse as to establish by Law all that
hath been by the mercies of God inacted in Generall
Assemblies. As to the rest of the first Article, concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390" id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Reformation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, and the Uniformity,
as there was some hopefull beginnings thereof, and
a good foundation laid, during the late War against the Popish
Prelaticall and Malignant party, so the state and ground
of the War being now altered, and these chosen for confederates,
and associates in the War, who are known enemies
to that Reformation, and Uniformity, how can the Covenant
be keeped in that point as long as such a War is carried
on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The second Article is violated because in stead of indeavouring
to extirpate Popery and Superstition without respect
of persons (as is exprest in the Covenant) there is in the
late Declaration of the Committee of Estates a desire of the
Queens return, without any condition tending to the restraint
of her Masse or exercise of Popery; We do also conceive
there is a tacit condescending to the toleration of Superstition
and the Book of Common prayer in His Majesties
family, because as it was reserved by himself in his concession,
brought home by the Commissioners of this Kingdom,
So these concessions were never plainly declared by the Parliament
to be unsatisfactory to their Lordships, howbeit it
hath been often and earnestly desired: neither can we conceive
how the clause concerning the extirpation of Prelacy,
can consist with indeavouring to bring His Majesty with
Honour, Freedom and Safety to one of his Houses in or
about LONDON, without any security had from him,
for the abolition of Prelacy; it being his known principle
(and publickly declared by himself shortly after he
went to the Isle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wight</span></span>) that he holds himself obliged
in conscience, and by his Coronation Oath to maintain
Archbishops, Bishops, &amp;c. Can it be said that they are endeavouring
to extirpate Prelacy, who after such a Declaration
would put in His Majesties hand an opportunity to restore
it?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the third Article we cannot conceive how the preserving
of the Priviledges of Parliament, and asserting the
Kings negative voice can consist; And we are sorrowfull
that under the colour, of the Priviledges of Parliament,
the liberties of the Subjects are overthrown, and the persons
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Estates of such as have been best affected to the Cause and
Covenant are exposed to most grievous injuries, crying oppressions:
And whereas the duty in preserving and defending
his Majesties Person and Authority, is by the third
Article of the Covenant qualified with, and subordinate
unto the preservation and defence of the true Religion and
Liberties of the Kingdoms, There is no such qualification,
nor subordination observed in the present Engagement, but
on the contrary, it is so carried on, as to make duties to
God and Religion conditionall, qualified, limited; and
duties to the King absolute and unlimited.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fourth Article of the Covenant is so foully broken,
that they who were by that Article declared Enemies, Incendiaries,
Malignants, and therefore to be brought to
condigne tryall and punishment, are now looked upon as
friends and associates, and are the men who get most favour
and protection, and sundry of them imployed in places
of trust, in the Army and Committees.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the fifth Article, instead of endeavouring to preserve
Peace and Union, a breach is endeavoured between the
Kingdoms, not only by taking in and garrisoning their
frontire Towns, but also entering the Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
with an Army, and joyning with the common enemies of
both Kingdoms, notwithstanding of an offer of a Treaty
upon the Propositions of both Kingdoms made by the Parliament
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> to the Parliament of this Kingdom. And
whether the way of this Engagement can consist with the
large Treaty between the Kingdoms, we shall with the Honourable
Committee of Estates may yet take it into their
serious second thoughts.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The sixth is also manifestly broken, for we are thereby
obliged to assist and defend all those that entered into this
League and Covenant, in maintaining and pursuing thereof:
Whereas the Army now entered into <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, is
to assist and defend many who have not entered into that League
and Covenant: And for those who took the Covenant
in that Nation. and continue faithfull in it, what they may
expect from this Army, may be collected not onely from
their carriage towards their Brethren at home; but also
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg 392]</span><a name="Pg392" id="Pg392" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from that clause toward the close of the late Declaration of
the Committee of Estates, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">And that we will do prejudice or use
violence to none (as far as we are able) but to such as oppose us, or
such ends above mentioned.</span></span> It cannot be unknown that many
of the English Nation who are firm and faithfull to the Covenant,
and Presbyteriall Government do, and will according
to their places and callings oppose some of those ends
above mentioned in that Declaration, as namely, the restoring
both of King and Queen without any condition
or security first had from them; And so by that rule in the
Declaration they must expect to be used as enemies, not
as friends. That sixth Article is also broken by a departing
from the first principles and resolutions: and by dividing,
and withdrawing from those that adhere thereunto, which
hath been before cleared by the Commission of the late Generall
Assembly in their Declaration in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span>, Representation,
and other Papers published in Print.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. We leave it to be seriously pondered by every one who
is truely conscientious, whether it be any ways credible
or probable, or agreeable to Scripture rules, that the generality
of all that have been most faithfull and cordiall to the
Covenant and cause of God should be deceived, deluded
and darkened in this businesse, and that they who for the
most part were enemies to the work of God in the beginning,
and have never brought forth fruits meet for Repentance,
should now finde out the will of God more than his
most faithfull Servants in the Land, and who, that fears
God, will believe that Malignants are for the ends of the
Covenant and that they who are most instrumental in the
Reformation, are against the ends of the Covenant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All which considered, as we could not, without involving
our selves in the guiltinesse of so unlawfull an Engagement,
yeeld to the desire of the Army for Ministers to be
sent by us to attend them; So we do earnestly exhort, and
in the name and authority of Jesus Christ, charge and require
all and every one of the Members of this Reformed
Kirk of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. That they search narrowly into the sins which have
Procured so great judgements and so sad an interruption
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the work of God, that they examine themselves, consider
their wayes, be much in humiliation and prayer, study
a reall and practicall Reformation, That they also mourn
and sigh for the abominations of the Land, and stand in
the gap to turn away the wrath, Among all these fearfull
sins, the violation of the Solemn League and Covenant,
would not be forgotten but seriously laid to heart, as that
which eminently provoketh the Lord and procureth his
judgements to be powred forth not onely upon persons and
families, but also upon States and Kingdoms. Covenant-breakers
through in common things, are reckoned by
the Apostle in that Catalogue of the abominations of the
Gentiles: But among the people of God, where his great
name is interposed, the breach of Covenant even in meaner
matters, such as the setting of servants at liberty provoketh
the Lord to say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Behold I proclaim a liberty for you (saith
the Lord) to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine, and
I will give the men that hath transgressed my Covenant,</span></span> and
(not excepting, but expressly mentioning Princes) he
addes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will give them into the hands of their enemies,</span></span> The
History of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gibeonites</span></span>, who surreptitiously procured the
Covenant made to spare them, and whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saul</span></span> some ages thereafter
in his zeal to the children of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Israel</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judah</span></span> sought to
slay, as being cursed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Canaanites</span></span>, evidenceth with what
vengeance, the LORD followeth Covenant-breakers,
whereof there wants not in prophane History also both forreign
and domestick examples: Therefore let all the inhabytants
of the Land of whatsoever rank, seriously ponder how
terrible judgements the violation of a Covenant so recently,
so advisedly, so solemnly made, and in so weighty matters,
may draw on, if not timously prevented by speedy repentance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. That they so respect and honour Authority, as that
they be not the servants of men, nor give obedience to the
will and authority of Rulers in any thing which may not
consist with the word of God, but stand fast in the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made them free, and obey God rather
then men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. That they carefully avoid the dangerous rocks and
snares of this time, whereby so many are taken and broken.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Upon the one hand the sowre leaven of Malignancy where
ever it enters, spoileth and corrupteth the whole lump, postponing
Religion, and the Cause of God to humane interest,
what ever be pretended to the contrary, and obstructing
the work of Reformation, and propagation of Religion out
of false respects and creature interest. As this hath formerly
abounded in the land, to the prejudice of the Cause and
Work of God, so of late it is revived, spreading with specious
pretences of vindicating wrongs done to his Majesty.
We desire not to be mistaken, as if respect and love to his
Majesty were branded with the infamous mark of Malignancy;
But hereby we warn all who would not come under
this soul stain, not onely in their speech and profession,
but really &amp; in their whole carriage not to prefer their own,
and the interest of any creature whatsoever, before the
interest of CHRIST and Religion. The characters of
these have been fully given in former Declarations, specially
in the Declaration of the Commissioners of the Generall Assembly
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">March</span></span> last, which we hold as here repeated;
onely adding this, that they ordinarily traduce Kirk Judicatures,
as medling with civill affairs, which as it is no
new calumny, but such as hath been cast upon the servants
of GOD in former times; so the whole course of proceedings
doth manifestly confute the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon the other hand Sectarisme hath no lesse hindered
the blessed and glorious work of Reformation in our neighbour
Kingdom, against the venome whereof, lest it approach
and infect this Kirk, we have need to watch diligently
to avoid all the beginnings and dangerous appearances thereof.
The many faithfull testimonies from godly Ministers
in severall parts of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, against the vile errours, and
abominable blasphemies abounding there, as they are to us
matter of rejoicing before the Lord; so they ought to be looked
on as warnings to all sorts of people, especially that regard
Religion, to beware of Sathans snares, craftily set to
catch their souls. And because such gangreens creep insensibly,
all that love the Honour of GOD, and welfare of
Religion, would seriously consider the following points,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both by way of marks to discern; and meanes to escape the
danger of this infection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Whosoever are misprises of the blessed work of Reformation
established within this Land, and do not shew
themselves grieved for the impediments and obstructions
it hath met with in our neighbour Kingdom, these are
even on the brink of this precipice, ready to tumble down
in this gulf whensoever occasion is offered: All therefore
that love the Lord Jesus, would stir up their hearts in the
light and strength of the Lord highly to prize, and thankfully
to acknowledge what the right hand of the most High
hath done among us, as also to thirst fervently after the advancing
and perfecting of the LORD's work among our
neighbours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Disrespect to the publick Ministery and Ordinances is
a symptome of a dangerous inclination to that disease: And
therefore as all Christs Ministers ought to stir up themselves,
to walk as becometh their high and holy calling lest they be
stumbling blocks to the people of God; so all the people of
God ought most carefully to stir up themselves unto a precious
estimation of the Ordinances of God, &amp; highly to esteem
the Stewards thereof for their works sake. A duty at all times
needful but now especially, when Sathan by all means endevours
the contrary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Indifferency in points of Religien, and pleading for
Toleration to themselves or others how far soever different
among themselves, is not to be forgotten among the characters
of Sectaries, and therefore ought the more carefully to be
avoided and opposed by all who desire to hold fast the profession
of their faith without wavering.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. They who are glorying in, and seeking after new lights,
or under the pretext of them are self-conceited in singular opinions,
or who affect new and strange expressions, are entring
into the snare ready to be carried about with every
winde of Doctrine. And therefore albeit we ought always as
Disciples of the Lord to set ourselves as in his sight to be
taught by his Spirit according to his Word, yet in this time so
fertil of errours; it becommeth all the lovers of truth to hold
fast what they have received, that no man take their Crown.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Whosoever brings in any opinion or practise in this
Kirk contrary to the confession of Faith, Directory of Worship
or Presbyterian Government may be justly esteemed to
be opening the door to Schisme and Sects: And therefore
all depravers or misconstructers of the proceedings of Kirk-Judicatories,
especially the Generall Assembly would take
heed least by making a breach upon the walls of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></span>
they make a patent way for Sectaries to enter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. They who separate the Spirit from the Word, and
pretend the Spirit, when they have no ground or warrant
from the Word, are already taken in an evill snare, And
therefore tis necessary to try the Spirits whither they are of
God, for many false Prophets are gone out into the world,
if they speak not according to the word it is because there is
no light in them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Besides the former, these are also marks of a Sectary; If
any commend, and recommend to others, or spread and divulge
the erroneous books of Sectaries, If any allow, avow,
or use Conventicles or private meetings forbidden by the
Acts of the Generall Assembly 1641. and 1647. last past,
If any be unwilling, and decline to reckon Sectaries among
the enemies of the Covenant, from whom danger is to be
apprehended, And (though we disallow the abusing and
Idolizing of learning to the patrocinie of Errour or prejudice
of piety) if any contemn literature as needlesse at best,
if not also hurtfull to a Minister.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we thus expreste our selves for preventing the
dangers of Sects and Schismes, it is far from our intention
to discourage any from the duties of piety, and mutuall
edification, according to the directions of the last Assembly
published in Print, and seriously recommended by them,
or to give any advantage to Malignants and Prophane persons,
with whom it is frequent to cast upon all those who
adhere to former principles, and cannot approve the present
Engagement, the odious nick-names of Sectaries and Independents.
For the beter discovery of such prophane mockers,
we give these markes and characters. 1. They do prophanely
and tauntingly abuse the name of the Spirit, under
that name deriding the work of Grace and sanctification.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
2. They esteem and speak of exercises of conscience, as
fancies, or fits of melancholy. 3. They mock at Family-worship
and the means of mutuall edification so much recommended
by the last Assembly in their directions. 4. They
do usually calumniate godly Ministers, and professors who
follow holinesse, with the names of Sectaries, or the like
odious names, without any just cause: As we account all
such to be enemies to the practise and power of godlinesse;
So we do exhort all the lovers of truth to hold on in the way
of holinesse through good report and ill report, being stedfast,
immovable, alwayes abounding in the work of the
Lord, forasmuch as they know their labour is not in vain in
the Lord.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. That they do not concur in, nor any way assist this
present Engagement, as they would not partake in other
mens sins, and so receive of their plagues, but that by the
grace and assistance of Christ they stedfastly resolve to suffer
the rod of the wicked, and the utmost which wicked mens
malice can afflict them with, rather then to put forth their
hand to iniquity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. That they suffer not themselves to be abused with fair
pretences and professions usuall in the mouths of those that
carry on this designe, and often published in their Papers,
But remember that the foulest actions have not wanted
specious pretences; And if they who killed the Apostles
did both pretend and intend to do God good service, what
marvell that they who engage against the Covenant pretend
to engage for it. Neither is it to be forgotten, That
after the first subscription of our Nationall Covenant, these
who had the chief hand in managing publick affairs, and had
subscribed the Covenant, especially the Duke of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lenox</span></span>,
and Captain James then Earl of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arran</span></span>, in the years 1581,
1582, 1583, 1584. when their designe was to subvert both
the Doctrine and Discipline of this Kirk, yet gave great
assurances by promises and Oaths to the contrary. At
the Assemblies 1598, 1599, 1600. It was declared with
many vows and attestations by the King, Statesmen, and
these Ministers who were aspiring to Prelacy, That
they intended no such thing as a change of the Government
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Kirk, or an introducing of Episcopacy, yet they
were really doing what they disclaimed and professed not to
do. And suppose that some who have an active hand in carrying
on the present publick affairs, have no design either
to destroy Religion, or utterly to sleight it: yet the way
they are on, and work they are about as it is contrived,
doth of its self, and in its own nature tend to the endangering,
if not to the utter subversion of Religion, for it cannot
be denyed, but the very undertaking of this War, sets
the once suppressed Malignants on work again, and successe
therein puts them in a capacity to set up according to their
principles abolished and abjured corruptions; which will
be the more hardly hindered, considering his Majesties propension,
and professed resolution that way, Especially seeing
His Majesties concessions (though it hath been often
desired) have never been plainly declared unsatisfactore by
the Parliament. And who in reason can think that any more
then His Majesties concessions sent from the Isle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wight</span></span>
will be required of him, by them who thereupon have proceeded
to this Engagement. The Kings negative voice (asserted
in the Papers of the Commissioners of this Kingdom
unto <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, which are owned in the late Declaration to the
Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, as the sense of this Kingdom) considered
in relation to Religion makes the danger yet the greater
and more palpable, yea, may reach further to shake
and unsettle Religion established in this Land; If to the premises
this be added which is not only often declared, but
also demanded, That his Majestie be brought to one of his
houses in Honour, Freedom and Safety, which may infer the
admitting of his Maj. to the free exercise of his Royall power
before security had from him for Reeligion, or Application
made to him for the same, who sees not now what hazard Religion
runs, certainly greater then a good intention can salve,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. That they do not mistake, or misunderstand the nature
of the true Reformed Religion and of the Government
of JESUS CHRIST, as if thereby either the Prerogative
of Kings, Privileges of Parliaments or Liberties of
Burghs, and other Corporations were any wayes hurt or
weakened: whereas indeed Religion is the main pillar and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upholder of civill authority, or Magistracie, and it is the
resisting, and not the receiving of the Government of
CHRIST, which hath overturned civill powers. If the
Throne be established by righteousnesse (as we are plainly
taught by the Word of God) then it is overthrowne by unrighteousnesse
and iniquity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. That they beware of all things which may ensnare
their consciences, as evill councell, evill company,
false informations, rash promises, and especially that they
beware of taking any Oathes, subscribing any Bonds, which
may relate to the Covenant and Cause of God, unlesse such
Oaths or Bonds be approved by the General Assembly or
their Commissioners for the publique affairs of the Kirk.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. That they do not cast away their confidence, nor
sink into despair, because of the present dangers and difficulties,
but live by faith, waite for better times, and continue
stedfast as seeing him who is invisible, firmly beleeving
that such a course as is not of God but against him, will come
to naught.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. To remember, that as the violation of the Covenant
by some in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> doth not set us free from the observation
thereof, and as no laws nor authority on earth can
absolve us from so solemn an obligation to the most High
God (which not onely hath been professed by this Kirk
but in a Petition of the City of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, and in publique
Testimonies of many of the Ministery of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>). So we are
not acquited and assoiled from the obligation of our solemn
Covenant, because of the troubles and confusions of the times;
But that in the worst of times all those duties, whereunto
by Covenant we oblige ourselves, do still lie upon us,
for we have sworn (and must perform it) concerning that
Cause and Covenant wherein we solemnly Engaged, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That
we shall all the dayes of our lives zealously and constantly continue
therein against all opposition, and promove the same according to our
power against all lets and Impediments whatsoever.</span></span> And if against
all lets and impediments whatsoever, then the altering of
the way of opposition, or of the kinde of impediments doth
not alter the nature, or the Joye of the Covenant, but we are
obliged to all the duties therein contained.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We doe also exhort and charge in CHRISTS Name
the Prince of Pastors, all the Ministers within this Kirk,
that in no wayes they be accessary to this sinful Engagement,
but in all their conferences and reasoning especially, in
their publick Doctrine, they declare themselves freely, and
faithfully, as they would eschew the wrath of GOD, due
for a violated Covenant, and as they would escape the censures
of the Kirk; and let all Presbyteries be watchful within
their bounds, and carefully, wisely, and zealously to inflict
Ecclesiastick censures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Finally, we exhort all civil Iudicatories, and every one
intrusted with power to manage the present affairs, That
they would seriously remember the strict account they are
to give before the Iudge of the quick and the dead, Considering
deeply how fearful a thing it is to oppresse the consciences
of their Brethren, either by pressing them to act
where they finde no satisfactory warrant or by putting heavy
pressures upon them for not acting according to their injunctions,
and especially that they offer not to insnare by
new Oaths, or Bonds those that make conscience of the
great Oath of their Solemn Covenant, and hitherto have
proven faithful and constant in promoving joyntly all the
ends thereof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If this our faithful warning finde favourable acceptance,
so that the grievous things already enacted, be no more prosecuted
and pressed, we shall blesse God who reigns in the
Kingdoms and Councels of men: But if it fall out otherwise
(as God forbid) we have liberate our souls of the guiltinesse
of this sinful way of Engagement, and of all the miseries
that shall ensue thereby upon this Kirk and Kingdom,
And shall lament before the Lord that our labours have not
as yet had the desired successe. In the meantime, we dare
not cast away our confidence, but trusting in the name of the
Lord, and staying upon our God, shall by his grace and assistance
continue stedfast in our Solemn Covenants, and
faithful in all the duties of our Calling.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The General Assembly having considered the Paper of
the 28. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July</span></span>, delivered to them from the Honourable
Committee of Estates, Do finde that the first part thereof
concerning the great Offers made by the Parliament
and Committee of Estates for the security of Religion, is
no other but what was fully answered in our last Paper of
the 25. of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">July</span></span>, delivered to their Lordships, wherein
it was plainly demonstrat by Theologicall reasons (though
their Lordships are pleased to call them Politick) that the
present Engagement is inconsistent with the safety and security
of Religion. Next whereas it is affirmed in their Lordships
Paper, that the grounds and reasons are the same which
were fully answered before, we wish it had been instanced
when and where they were answered, for we know no such
thing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another reflection upon that former Paper of ours is thus
expressed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That the Generall Assembly hath proceeded to such a
Declaration before they had in an Ecclesiaslick way from clear testimonies
out of the Word of God or convencing of our consciences, demonstrate
the unlawfulnesse of the undertaking</span></span>: Where we can see
no reason why it should seem so very strange to the Honourable
Committee that the Generall Assembly hath so proceeded
to a Declaration of their judgement concerning this
businesse, For as it hath been no unusuall thing, but very
ordinary that approved Synods, both Provinciall, Nationall,
and Oecumeniall have declared their judgement
without publishing the particular grounds &amp; reasons thereof
from Scripture (a work more proper for full Tractates then
for Synodicall Decrees or Cannons.) So if their Lordships
had been pleased to attend (for many attended not) the
late Parliament-Sermons mainly intended for their Lordships
information, and had with mindes unprejudiced,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hearkened thereunto, and searched in to all the Papers lately
published in Print by the Commission of the last Assembly,
they might have been by the blessing of God convinced
from the Word of God of the unlawfulnesse of the present
Engagement.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are three things which may justly seem to us more
strange: One is, That the Declaration of Parliament having
given assurance in this manner, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We are resolved not to ingage in
any War before the necessity and lawfulnesse thereof be cleared, so as
all who are wel-affected may be satisfied therewith</span></span>, yet now they
have ingaged in War without any such clearing of the necessity
and lawfulnesse thereof, or satisfaction given to the
wel-affected.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another is, that although there are so great professions
and offers in the generall to satisfie what can be desired for
the security of Religion, yet none of those particulars desired
by the late Commission of the Kirk for the security of
Religion have been granted. We shall here onely give instance
in one of those desires, which was, that his Majesties
concessions and offers concerning Religion, sent home
from the Isle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wight</span></span>, having been found by the said
Commission unsatisfactory and destructive to the Covenant,
might be by the Parliament declared unsatisfactory to their
Lordships.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this great point there hath been no satisfaction given,
onely it was lightly touched in one clause of the Parliaments
Declaration, and so ambiguously expressed, as might suffer
many interpretations, and although this ambiguity was
clearly laid open by the Commissioners of the last Generall
Assembly in their Representation; yet to this day there hath
been nothing published neither by the Parliament nor Committee
of Estates to give any clearer satisfaction, by disclaiming
those offers and concessions as unsatisfactory to the parliament:
So that this (if there were no more) gives us
great cause to apprehend that there is a greater mystery latent
in that businesse then yet appeareth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A third thing which seemeth strange to us is, That their
Lordships desire of arguments from Scripture to prove the
unlawfulnesse of this Engagement was not propounded to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Commissioners of the last Assembly, before the emitting of
the Declaration of Parliament, and before the Levies (when
it had been most orderly &amp; seasonable) but is now propounded
after publick resolutions and Declarations, yea not till
those resolutions are put in actuall execution.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
However seeing their Lordships do now desire proofs
from Scripture for the unlawfulnesse of the Engagement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We answer, That as joyning and concurring in this Engagement
is unlawfull to all the wel-affected in this Kingdom,
their consciences being altogether unsatisfied in the
lawfulnesse thereof; and as it is unlawfull in the manner of
putting it in execution, being accompanied with so many
injuries, oppressions, and crying abominations, and with
so much persecution of piety; so it is unlawfull in the own
nature of it, and as it is stated upon the grounds of the Declarations
of Parliament, and Committee of Estates. And
this unlawfulnesse of the Engagement in it self, we have
demonstrate in the Declaration herewith communicate to
their Lordships, unto which we remit them for satisfaction
in that point, and do nor doubt but their Lordships may be
convinced thereby of the evill of their way, and that it is so
far from being a pious and necessary Engagement (as their
Lordships are pleased to call it) that it is a most unlawfull and
sinfull Engagement to be repented of, and forsaken by all
that have any hand in it, as they desire to make their peace
with God, And we heartily wish that their Lordships subsequent
proceedings may be reall testimonies, that their
calling for Scripture proofs was from a reall desire to be informed
and edified.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to their Lordships other desire of our demonstrating
from the Word of God, that the Kirk hath interest in the
undertakings and Engagements in War, and what that
interest is, We had thought this point to be without controversie
in this Kingdom, not onely in respect of Kirk and
State, their joyning and co-operating (each in their proper
sphere,) in the former Expeditions of this Kingdom into
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, but also because the very Conferences which
have been between Committees of Kirk and State concerning
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this undertaking and Engagement, doth plainly suppose
an interest of the Kirk in such affairs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If their Lordships mean any politick interest in such undertakings,
we claim no such thing, if the meaning be of a
Spirituall interest and so far as concerneth the point of Conscience,
there can be no doubt thereof made by such as do
with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">David</span></span> make the testimonies of the Lord their Counsellers,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Psalm</span></span> 119. 24. And consult with God as he used to do
in undertaking War: It is also to be remembred that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Joshua</span></span>
and all the Congregation of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Israel</span></span> were commanded to go out
and in at the word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eliazer</span></span> the priest, who was to aske councell
of the Lord for them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Numb.</span></span> 27. 28. Hath not the
Word of God prescribed to the Christian Magistrate the Rules
of a Lawfull War, And doth it not belong, to particular
Ministers, much more to the Assemblies of the Kirk, to
declare the minde of God from Scripture, for all sorts of duties,
and against all sorts of sins. And if the present War be
a case of conscience, and alledged to be the most fit and necessary
means for preservation of Religion, who seeth not
that the Kirk hath an undoubted interest in resolving and
determining such a case of Conscience from the word of God.
This we shall onely adde, that whereas in the Parliaments
Letter to the Presbyteries there instances were adduced by
way of reflection upon the proceedings of the late Commission,
as medling with Civill matters in which they had no
Interest, The Commission did in their Printed Vindication
so clear from Scripturall grounds their Interest in such
things as their Lordships might have been easily satisfied in
that point. We shall here onely mention one passage containing
a good and safe rule for such Cases, The Duties of
the second Table, as well as of the first, as namely, The
Duties between King and Subject, Parents and Children,
Husbands and Wives, Masters and Servants, and the like
being contained in, and to be taught and cleared from the
Word of God, are in that respect, and so far as concerneth
the point of Conscience, a subject of Ministeriall Doctrine,
and in difficult cases a subject of cognizance and Judgement,
to the Assemblies of the Kirk.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the necessity of preserving a right understanding and
mutuall confidence betwixt the Churches of Christ in
both Kingdoms constrain us, so the good acceptance and
the suitable affections that the Declaration of the last Generall
Assembly met with in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> from the Lovers of the
Covenant and present Reformation, together with the many
Testimonies that have of late been given unto the Truth in
that Land, invites and incourages us to make known unto
our Brethren there, our sense of the present condition of
publick affairs, so far as concerns <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Religion</span></span> and the point of
Conscience.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The dispensation of God in ruling of the Nations, and in
the revolutions of his Providence towards them, is full of
wonder in all the earth; And we, who live in this Island,
have cause to look upon it with speciall observation, in regard
of that which concerns our selves. For many generations
these two Kingdoms stood at odds and were the instruments
of many sufferings and calamities one to another, untill
at last the Lord having compassion upon both, did unite
them under one King; which great and long desired Blessing
hath received such increase from our being united together
in one League and Covenant as doth adde much to the
good and happinesse of both Nations: Therefore is it to be
looked upon by all the Lovers of Truth and Peace in these
Lands as a just ground of much thanksgiving &amp; many praises
unto GOD, even in the day of our greatest calamity
and affliction what ever befall, as we know no cause why
we should forget so a great a mercy or repent of so good a
work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But as the common Enemies of these Kingdoms studied
by all means to keep them from entring into that Covenant,
so hath all their power and Policy, now, for five years past,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been imployed to bring it to nought. As soon as it had being
the Popish, Prelaticall and Malignant Party did bend all
their forces against it; and when by the mighty hand of
GOD they were scattered and brought to confusion, in
their stead stood up in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> a generation who have perverted
the Truth, and by turning aside into Errour have obstructed
the work of Reformation; and by forsaking of the
Covenant, and forgetting of the Oath of GOD, have
brought a great reproach upon his Name, and made the
Enemy to blaspheme; whose unthankfulnesse and unstedfastnesse,
with the many provocations of these Lands, hath provoked
the Lord again to raise out of the dust the horn of
Malignants, and to arm them with such power as is terrible
to his People, and threatenes his Work with ruine. And
albeit, we acknowledge our selves bound and are still resolved
to preserve and defend his Majesties Person and Authority
in the preservation and defence of the true Religion and Liberties
of the Kingdoms: Yet it is unto us matter of very
great sorrow and grief that so many in our Land should so
far joyn in Malignant Designes, and that there should be
found amongst us who have undertaken and are now putting
in execution an unlawfull War promoving their ends and
opposing and making void (so far as in them lies) the Ends
of the Covenant: Neverthelesse in this we cannot but rejoyce
that they went not without a Witnesse and a Warning
disswading them to go.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And we desire our Brethren of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> to know, that as a
very considerable number of the Members of the Parliament
did dissent from and protest against the proceedings of
the major part in reference to this Engagement so all the
particular Synods and Presbyteries in this Kingdom, excepting
some few, who by reason of their remotenesse and
shortenesse of time had not the opportunity, have most
harmoniously joyned with and seconded the Desires of the
Commissioners of the General Assembly for preventing so
unlawful a War: And now the Commissioners out of all
the Provinces conveened in this National Assembly, as
after an exact examination they have unanimously approved
the proceedings of the Commissioners of the former Assembly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
against that Engagement; so have they emitted a Declaration
to all the People of GOD in this Land, shewing
it to be contrary to GODS Word and to the solemn League
and Covenant. Neither have Ministers onely by their
preaching, and Kirk Iudicatories by their Petitions and
Declarations given testimony against it; but many others
in this Land also by supplicating the High and Honourable
Court of Parliament for satisfaction to their Conscience
thereanent: And when it could not be obtained many
have chosen rather to suffer the spoiling of their goods with
joy, then to sin against GOD by complying with an evil
course. And many of the Officers of our former
Army, who are of special note for their good carriage and
deserving in the Cause of GOD, have rather choosed to
quit their charges then to joyn in it: Nay, the well-affected,
both Ministers and People, as they do bear testimony
against it before men, so groan under it before
GOD. So that this character may justly be put upon it by
all who shall speak of it now or in after Ages, That as it is
a foul breach of the Covenant under a pretence and profession
of being for the ends of the Covenant, so being carried
on against the Consciences of the people, and contrary
to the most harmonious and universal Testimonies of many
Presbyteries and Synods that have been given against it, it is
a sinning with many witnesses. A paralel will hardly be
found in this or in any other Land wherein a publick sinful
course hath been carried on with so high a hand against the
Consciences of the People of GOD, and against so many
Warnings of the Servants of GOD, and general opposition
from the Judicatories of the Kirk; which yet is the
less to be wondred at, because the greatest part of those
who have been most active in contriving and carrying on of
the fame, were either once open Enemies, or alwayes
secret underminers, or indifferent and neutral in the Cause
of GOD.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But whatsoever be the falling away of such, we shall desire
and do expect that our Brethren in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, who continue
faithful, may rest confident of the generality of all
such of this Kingdom as were at first active in promoting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Covenant and Work of Reformation, that they are also
still faithful in adhering thereunto, and walking after their
former principles do resolve to abide stedfast and to hold
fast the bands of Brotherhood and union between these
Kingdoms: Neither are we lesse confident of the like Resolutions
and Affections of our Brethren in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>: The
many Testimonies which the Truth and Cause of
CHRIST, the Covenant and Presbyterial Government
have lately received from that cloud of Witnesses of the
Ministery in several Provinces and Countries of that Kingdom,
after the example of the worthy Ministery of the City of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, against the Errours of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Independency,
Anabaptism, Antinomianisin, Arminianism, Socinianism, Faminism,
Libertinism, Sceptism, Erastianism,</span></span> and other new
and dangerous Doctrines spred and received amongst many
in that Nation; As they are unto us matter of great praise
and hearty thanksgiving unto GOD, so also an evidence
of the stedfastness of many in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and a token for good,
and a wide door of hope that the Lord will perfect his Work
and bring forth the headstone of his House in that Land.
It shall be the wisdom of each Nation to keep the golden
path of truth and righteousnesse betwixt the crooked
wayes of Malignants upon the one hand and Secteries upon
the other, and for each of the Nations so to look upon another,
as to distinguish betwixt the prevalent part and the
better part, and betwixt friends and foes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We conceive it to be high time for both Nations to search
and try their ways and turn again to the LORD, that he who
hath wounded us may heal us, and he who hath broken us
may binde us up. The sin of both hath been the departing
from the rule of the Covenant, and that we did not trust
God for the prefecting of his Work, walking by the rule
of piety, but took ourselves to humane polices, and endeavoured
to carry it on by carnal and worldly means. For
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> did to much connive at and comply with Malignants,
which is the immediate and neerest cause of all our
present troubles and distractions; so <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> neglecting to
hold fast the truth and to submit themselves to the Government
of Jesus Christ, so clearly held forth by the pious and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
learned Assembly of Divines, did connive at many abominable
Blasphemies and Errors, and complying with Sectaries,
gave way to their wicked Toleration. Neither is it
the least part of the sin of both Lands, that they have more
minded the outward then the inward Reformation, the erecting
of the outward Fabrick of GODS House, then
the providing furniture for it by advancing the power of the
Gospel, that his glory may be seen in his Temple. Because
of these things is there great wrath from the LORD against
these Kingdoms, and this controversie shall be continued
until we really turn away from our crooked paths.
Therefore as we wish that none of this Land may flatter
themselves in their evil wayes, but repent and amend, so
we desire our Brethren of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> to consider what hath been
the bitter fruits of their slow progresse in and neglect of the
Work of Reformation, and of their connivance at and complying
with Sectaries, and to do no more so, but that whatsoever
is commanded by the God of Heaven, it be diligently
done for the House of the God of Heaven.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We trust that the Parliament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> will be wise to
remember and consider the great mercies of GOD towards
them in delivering them from all their Enemies, &amp; the many
opportunities put into their hands for advancing and establishing
the work of Reformation; for neglect whereof
God hath now again threatned to lift up their Enemies above
them, that he may once more prove what they will do for
his Name, and for setling the order of his House. God
forbid that they should run from one extream to another,
from compliance with Sectaries to compliance with Malignants,
and hearken to terms of an unsafe and sinful Peace,
We cannot but abhor the purposes of any who minde the
subversion of Monarchical Government, which we heartily
wish to be preserved and continued in his Majesties Person,
and Posterity; and we do no lesse dislike the Practises of
those who deal so hardly with his Majesties Person, earnestly
desiring that he were in the condition he was into by the advice
of both Kingdoms before he was taken away by a party
of Sir <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thomas Fairfax</span></span> Army; Nor are we against the restoring
of the King to the exercise of his power in aright order
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and way. Yet considering what great expence of blood
and pains these Kingdoms have been at for maintaining their
just liberties and bringing the Work of Reformation this
length; And considering his Majesties great aversnesse from
setling Reformation of Religion, and his adhering still to
Episcopacy; We trust that security will be demanded and
had from his Majesty for Religion, before he be brought
to one of his Houses in or neer about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, with honour,
freedom and safety. And considering of what importance
the solemne League and Covenant is unto all the interests of
both Kingdoms concerning their Religion, Liberties and
Peace, to make an agreement without establishing of it,
were not only to rob these Nations of the blessings they have
already attained by it, but to open a door to let in all the corruptions
that have been formerly in the Kirks of God in these
lands, &amp; all the abuses and usurpations that have been in the
civil government, &amp; again to divide these two Kingdoms that
are now so happily united and conjoyned: &amp; therefore as we
wish that all mis-understanding betwixt the Nations, &amp; betwixt
the King &amp; People may be removed, that there may be
a happy &amp; lasting Peace, so that there may be no agreement
without establishing and enjoyning the Covenant in all these
three Kingdoms; and that for this end God would give
wisdom to all that are intrusted in the managing of publick
Affairs that they may seasonably discover and carefully avoid
all snares which may be laid either by Sectaries, or Malignants,
or both, under colour of a Treaty of Peace. And
we are confident, through the Lord, that all the obstructions
and oppositions, by which his work has been retarded
and interrupted in this Island, shall not onely be taken
out of the way, but shall turn to the advantage and furtherance
of it at last. The onely wise God can and will bring
about his holy purposes by unlikely, yea by contrary means:
And God forbid that either our Brethren in England
or our selves should give way to despondency of Spirit, and
cast away the hopes of that so much prayed for and so much
wished for Reformation of Religion, and Uniformity in
all the parts thereof according to the Covenant: And now
it is our hearts desire and prayer to God, that amidst the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
many tryals and tentations of these times, none of the Servants
of God and witnesses of Jesus Christ may be deserted,
or left to themselves to comply either with the Malignant
party upon the one hand, or with Sectaries upon the other.
Brethren pray for us, and the God of all grace, who hath
called us unto his eternal glory, after that ye have suffered a
while, make you perfect, stablish strengthen and settle you.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cease not to give thanks to the Father of our Lord
Jesus, by whose strength you keep the Word of his patience
now in these times, when many depart from the Faith,
giving heed to seducing Spirits; As also, that he who hath
founded <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zion</span></span>, hath been pleased, by our Covenant sworn
to the most high God, to lay the hopefull foundation of a
glorious Work in these three Kingdoms, to unite his People
therein, as one stick in the hand of the LORD.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We cannot but acknowledge to the Honour and Glory of
the Lord, Wonderfull in counsell and excellent in working,
that hee hath strongly united the spirits of all the godly in
this Kingdom, and of his Servants in the Ministery, first in
the severall Presbyteries and Synods, and now in this Nationall
Assembly, in an unanimous and constant adhering to
our first Principles and the Solemn League and Covenant,
And particularly in giving a testimony against the present
unlawfull Engagement in War: Yet it semeth good to the LORD who hath
his Fire in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zion</span></span> and Furnace in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerusalem</span></span>,
for the purging of the vessels of his house to suffer many adversaries
to arise with violence to obstruct and stop this great
and effectuall door, which the Lord hath opened unto us.
But we know that he openeth, and no man shutteth, and
shutteth, and no man openeth: yea, he will cause them
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who say they are for the Covenant and are not, but are Enemies
thereto, and do associate with Malignants or Sectaries,
to acknowledge that God hath loved us, and that his truth
is in us and with us. And now dearly beloved, seeing the
Lord hath kept you together so many years, when the battel
of the Warriour hath been with confused noise, and garments
rolled in blood, the Lord also sitting as a refiner to purifie
the Sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Levi</span></span>, and blessing you with unity and soundnesse
in the Faith, we are confident you will not cease to
give a publick testimony for Christ, both against Sectaries
and all Seducers, who prophecie lies in the name of the
LORD, and against Malignants and Incendiaries (the
Prelaticall and Popish Faction) who now again bestir themselves
to hold up the rotten and tottering throne of Antichrist,
and are (whatever they pretend) the reall enemies
of Reformation: As also, that as the Embassadors of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span> and his Watchmen, you will give seasonable warning
to the Honourable Houses of Parliament, that now
(after the losse of the opportunity of so many years) they
would, in their places, repair the Houses of the LORD,
that lyeth so long desolate, and promove the work of Reformation
and Uniformity according to the Covenant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For if the Honourable Houses of Parliament had timely
made use of that power, which God hath put in their hands
for suppressing of Sectaries, and had taken a speedy course
for setling of Presbyterial Government, (a speciall and effectuall
means appointed by God to purge his Church from
all scandals in Doctrine and Practise) Then had not the insolencie
of that party arisen to such a height, as to give occasion
to the Malignants of both Kingdoms to justifie and
blesse themselves in their old opposition to the work of Reformation,
and to encourage one another, to new and more
dangerous attempts; Neither had the Malignant party ever
grown so strong in this Kingdom, if the Sectaries had not
been connived at in ENGLAND; For their prime
pretence (for their present rising in Armes) is, that they
may suppress the Sectaries, and vindicate the King from
that base condition, unto which he is brought by that party:
Yet these do not wisely, nor well, who avoiding or opposing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sectarisme, split themselves upon the rock of Malignancy,
and by taking that party by the hand how, do own
all the cruelty, bloodshed and other ungodly and unjust Acts,
which they have done since the beginning of this Reformation.
And as we take thankfully your testimony of your steering
so steady &amp; even a course between the dangerous rocks
of Prophanesse and Malignancy on the one hand, and of
Errours, Schisme, Heresie and Blasphemy on the other hand;
So we trust ye will not cease to give testimony against both
these evils, and represent the same to the Honourable Houses
of Parliament, as you shall have fit occasion; And that you
will gravely warne your dissenting Brethren what a door
they keep open for Errors, and Heresies, by their tenet of
Independency; Whereby they leave no means of Authoritative
Ecclesiastick Suppression of Errours; If an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Independent</span></span>
Congregation will please to own them. We also are confident
that you will be remembrancers to that famous City
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, and the whole Kingdom, of their Engagement
to the LORD, in the solemn League and Covenant:
Nor will we suffer our selves to believe that the wel-affected
in the Houses of Parliament, In the City of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, and
throughout that whole Kingdom will agree or harken to the
motions of any such Treaty of Peace, as leaves out the best
security for Religion, the Cause of GOD, and the solemn
League and Covenant. Thus desiring the continuance
of your Prayers to God for us, in this hour of temptation;
and promising (through his grace and strength) to continue
in prayers for you, We commit you to the infinite Wisdom,
Power, Goodnesse, and Faithfulnesse of our blessed God
and Father in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></span>, in whom we are,

Whereas the High and Honourable Court of Parliament
and your Lordships were pleased to injoyn the subscription
of a Declaration and Band of the date <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">June 10.
1648.</span></span> And we having found after such examination and tryal,
as is competent to the Servants of God in an Ecclesiastick
way, that the same is a snare to the Consciences of the People
of GOD in this Land to involve them in guiltinesse,
and to draw them from their former principles and Vows in
the solemn League and Covenant, as doth more fully appear
in our Act concerning the same herewith presented unto
your Lordships. Therefore from our zeal to the glory of
GOD and tender care of the souls committed unto us; and
for our exonoration, As we do seriously exhort that your
Lordships would be sensible of the guilt that you have already
brought upon your selves and others, by injoyning
and urging that subscription, So we do earnestly and in the
bowels of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span> intreat, That your Lordships would
take such order and course as that it may be no further
pressed upon the people of GOD throughout the
Land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And because the people groan under the violence and
oppression of Officers and Souldiers in their Quarterings of
otherwise throughout all the corners of the Countrey (which
as it hath ascended into the ears of the Lord of Hosts, so we
doubt not but it is come to your knowledge) We conceive
it to be incumbent to us to represent the same to your Lordships,
beseeching and obtesting you that as you would not
desire that the Lord should visit because of these things,
you would think upon an effectuall remedy for punishing
and redressing what is past, and preventing the like in time
coming.

and not speaking to the corruptions of the time.</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Generall Assembly, taking to their serious consideration,
the great scandals which have lately encreased,
partly through some Ministers their reserving and not
declaring of themselves against the prevalent sins of the
times, partly through the spite, Malignity, and insolency
of others against such Ministers as have faithfully and freely
reproved the Sins of the times without respect of persons,
Do therefore for preventing and removing such scandals
hereafter, Appoint and Ordain, that every Minister do by
the word of Wisdom apply his Doctrine faithfully against
the publick Sins and Corruptions of these times, and particularly
against the Sins and Scandals in that Congregation
wherein he lives, according to the Act of the Generall Assembly
1596. revived by the Assembly at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Glasgow</span></span>, 1638.
Appointing that such as shall be found not applying their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Doctrine to corruptions, which is the Pastorall gift, cold,
and wanting of Spirituall zeal, flatters and dissembling of
publick sins, and especially of great Personages in their
Congregations, that all such persons be censured according
to the degree of their faults and continuing therein be deprived;
And according to the Act of the Generall Assembly
1646. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sess.</span></span> 10. That beside all other scandals, silence, or
ambiguous speaking in the publike Cause much more detracting
and disaffected speeches be seasonably censured; As
therefore the Errours and exorbitancies of Sectaries in England
are not to be passed in silence, but plain warning to be
given of the danger of so near a contagion, that people
may beware of it, and such as neglect this duty to be Censured
by their Presbyteries, So it is thought fit and Appointted
by the Assembly, conform to the foresaid Acts. That
the main current of applications in Sermons may run along
against the evils that prevail at home, and namely against
the contempt of the Word, against all profanesse, against
the present defection from the League and Covenant, against
the unlawful Engagement in War, against the unlawful
Band and Declaration of the Date of the 10. of June ordained
to be subscribed by all the Subjects, and other unjust
Decrees established by Law, against the Plots and Practises
of Malignants, and against the Principles and Tenents of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Erastianism</span></span>, which spread among divers in this Kingdom;
For the better confutation whereof, it is hereby Recommended
to the Ministery to study that point of controversie
well, that they may be the more able to stop the mouths of
gainsayers: Tis also hereby Recommended to the several
Presbyteries and Provincial Synods, that they make special
enquiry and trial concerning all the Ministery in their
bounds, And if any be found too sparing general, or ambiguous
in the foresaid applications and reproofs that they
be sharply rebuked, dealt with, and warned to amend
under the pain of suspension from their Ministery; And if
after such warning given they amend not, that such be suspended
by Presbyteries, and in case of their negligence by
the Synods till the next General Assembly; But if there be
any, who do neglect and omit such applications and reproofs,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and continue in such negligence after admonition
and dealing with them, they are to be cited, and after due
triall of the offence to be deposed, for being pleasers of
men rather then servants of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christ</span></span>, for giving themselves to
a detestable indifferency or neutrality in the Cause of God, &amp;c.
for defrauding the souls of people, yea for being highly
guilty of the blood of souls in not giving them warning:
Much more are such Ministers to be censured with Deposition
from their Ministry who preach for the lawfulnes or
pray for the success of the present unlawfull Engagement,
or that go along with the Army themselves, or who subscribe
any Bands or take any Oaths not approved by the
General Assembly or their Commissioners, or by their counsel,
countenance or approbation make themselves accessory
to the taking of such Bands and Oaths by others: It is to be
understood that if any Minister preach in defence of or pray
for the successe of the Sectaries in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, he is likewayes
to be censured by deposition. And this we adde as a generall
rule to be observed on both hands, but not as if we had
found any of the Ministery of this Kingdom to be favourers
of the Sectaries in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in case any Minister for his freedom in preaching,
and faithfull discharge of his conscience shall be in the face
of the Congregation or elsewhere upbraided, railed at,
mocked, or threatened, or if any injury or violence be done
to his person, or any stop and disturbance made to him in
the exercise of his Ministeriall calling, The Presbyterie of
the bounds shall forthwith enter in processe with the offender,
and whoever he be Charge him to satisfie the Discipline
of the Kirk by publick Repentance, which if any do
not, or refuse to do, That then the Presbyterie proceed
to Excommunication against him; In all which Presbyteries
and Synods are to give an account of their diligence:
And the Assembly Appoints this Act to be intimate in the
several Congregations of this Kirk.

shall fail of their purpose to make them usefull for the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Generall Assembly considering that according
to the ancient practise and order of this Kirk, the
Censure of Suspension and Deposition of Ministers
is both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ab officio</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">â beuoficio</span></span>, as is

And that the continuance of suspended or deposed Ministers in the exercise
of the Ministery or in the possession of their stipend hath
been &amp; ought to be accompted and censured as a great contempt
of the Authority and Censures of the Kirk, Considering
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a name="Pg420" id="Pg420" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also that the continuance of deposed Ministers in the
possession of the stipend, is a great prejudice and obstruction
to the planting of the vaiking Kirk, and to the service of
God there. Therefore do declare and Ordain, That whosoever
after the sentence of Deposition pronounced against
them, Do either exercise any part of the Ministeriall calling
in the places they formerly served in; or elsewhere, or
do possesse, meddle, or intromet with the stipend or other
benefits whatsoever belonging to these Kirks they served
at, They shall be proceeded against with Excommunication;
And if any suspended Minister during his suspension, either
exercise any part of the Ministeriall Calling, or intromet
with the Stipend, That he be Deposed, And after deposition,
continuing in either of these faults, That he be
processed with Excommunication; But prejudice always to
them of their stipend resting for by-gone service and of any
recompence due for building or repairing of the Manse according
to the ordinary practise. And the Assembly recommends
to Presbyteries seriously to be carefull of the putting
of this Act in execution.

of his coming from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span> to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Newcastle</span></span> til
the last moment of his departure out of this life upon all occasions manifest
the constancy of his judgement touching the Work of Reformation
in these Kingdoms; Namely, in all his discourses
and conferences with his Majesty, and with his Brethren
who were employed with him in the same Trust at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Newcastle</span></span>,
In his Letters to the Commissioners at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">London</span></span>, and particularly
in his last discourse to his Majestie at his departing
from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Newcastle</span></span>, being very weak and greatly decayed in his
Naturall strength. When he was come from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Newcastle</span></span> by
sea to this Kingdom, he was in such a weak worn and
failed condition, as it was evident to all who saw him, that
he was not able to frame any such Declaration, for he was
so spent that he died within eight dayes after his arrivall;
And all that he was able to speak in that time did clearly
shew his judgement of, and affection to the Work of Reformation
and Cause of God to be every way the same then,
that it was in the beginning and progresse thereof, as divers
Reverend Brethren who visited him have declared to this
Assembly, and particularly two Brethren, who constantly
attended him from the time he came home till his breath
expired. A further testimony may be brought from a short
Confession of Faith under his hand found amongst his Papers,
which is expressed as his last Words, wherein among
other mercies he declareth himself <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">most of all obliged to the
grace and goodnesse of God for calling him to believe the Promises of
the Gospel, and for exalting him to be a Preacher of them to others,
and to be a willing though weak instrument in this great and wonderful
work of Reformation, which he earnestly beseecheth the Lord to
bring to a happy conclusion.</span></span> Other reasons may be added from
the levity of the stile and manifest absurdities contained in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that Paper. Upon confederation of all which this Assembly
doth condemn the said Pamphlet as forged, scandalous,
and false, And further Declare the author and contriver of
the same void of charity and a good conscience, and a grosse
lyar and calumniator led by the Spirit of the accuser of the
Brethren.

to cause his Majestie leave this Land to strong delusions to
believe lies; Therefore They Do in the name of GOD,
Charge and Require all the Presbyteries of this Kingdom to
observe and practice the Rules and Directions which are
made in former Generall Assemblies for preventing of the
said fearfull inconveniences, and namely the Overtures against
Papists, non-Communicants, and Profaners of the
Sabbath approven in the Generall Assembly held at St. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Andrews</span></span>
in the year of God, 1642. and the Act anent children
sent without the Kingdom made in the Generall Assembly
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edinburgh, Anno 1646.</span></span> And that they use all diligence
for putting in execution the Acts of Parliament and secret
Councell made against Papists &amp; Excommunicate Persons;
And that they register their diligences thereanent in their
Presbyterie Booke which are summarily to be recorded in
the Synod Books from time to time, That the Generall
Assembly may see how these laudable Acts are put in execution,
which here are presented with some necessary additions
in one view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. That every Presbyterie give a List of all Excommunicate
Papists they know to be within their bounds to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Commissioners of the Generall Assembly, and of all Papists;
yea of them also who professe to have renounced Popery,
but yet have their children educated abroad, with the
names of these children that are abroad, according to the
fifth Overture of the Generall Assembly, 1642.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. That every Presbyterie conveen at their first meeting
all known Papists within their bounds, and such as having
professed to renounce Popery have their children abroad,
and cause them finde sufficient caution for bringing home
within three moneths such of their children as are without
the Kingdom; to be educated in Schools and Colledges at
the Presbyteries sight if they be Minors; and to be wrought
upon by gracious conference, &amp; other means of instruction
to be reclaimed from Popery if they be come to perfect
age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The Parents, Tutors or Frinds of Children and
Minors shall, before they send them without the Kingdom,
first acquaint the Presbyterie where they reside, that they
may have their Testimoniall directed to the Presbyterie or
Classe within the Kingdom or Dominion beyond Seas
whither they intend to send their Children; And at the time
of these Childrens return, that they report a Testimoniall
from the Presbyterie or Synod where they lived without the
Kingdom, to the Presbyterie who gave them a Testimonial
at their going away, according to the Act anent Children sent
without the Kingdom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno 1646.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. That all Presbyteries give the names of such Pædagogs
as were abroad with the children of Noblemen within there
bounds, and diligently enquire whether these Pædagogs do
continue stedfast in the true Religion, and continue in their
service, or whither these Pædagogs do either become
corrupt in Religion, or (continuing constant) are removed
from their charge and by whom they are removed, and that
they signifie these things to the Generall Assembly from
time to time or their Commissioners, That they may represent
the same to the High Court of Parliament, Lords of
secret Counsell or Committe of Estates, for such remedie
as shall seem expedient to their Honours, for preventing of
and purging the land from the plague of Idolatrie.

5. That such Parents, Tutors or Friends as either send
away Children to forraign parts infected with Idolatry without
such Testimonialls as aforesaid, or do not recall them
who are already abroad within such time as is above prefixed,
or do remove from them their Protestant Pædagogs (that
they may the more easily be infected with Popery) be processed
and in case of not amending these things, be Excommunicated.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. That the names of such as are Excommunicated for
these or any other causes, be sent in to the Generall Assembly
from year to year, that (from thence) their names may
be notified in all the Kingdom, and that the Acts of Parliament
and secret Counsell may be put to execution against
them, and all diligence used for that effect; and that by the
effectuall dealing of the Generall Assembly, with the Parliament,
Lords of secret Counsell, or Committee of Estates,
their Lordships may Enact such further, just and severe
civill Punishment on such Excommunicants for Terror to
others, as shall be found necessary for purging this Covenanted
Land from all Abominations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Because persons addicted to Idolatry will use all means
for their own hardening in their Superstitious and Idolatrous
way, even within the Countrey; Therefore all known
Papists, or persons suspect of Poperie upon probable grounds
are to finde Caution before their Presbyteries, for their abstinence
from Masse, and from the Company of all Jesuits,
and Priests according to the second Overture against Papists,
made <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anno 1642.</span></span> Also Presbyteries are to presse them to
finde such Caution; And to observe what persons put their
Sons or Daughters to such Families as are tainted with Popery
within the Land, the same being a speciall mean to
corrupt them with Idolatry, And to cause such Parents
recall their Children, or else proceed with the Censures of
the Kirk against them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All which Overtures, Presbyteries are seriously required
and Ordained to observe diligently with Certification,
That they shall be severely censured, If they shall be found
remisse or negligent in any of these points, which are so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
necessary for keeping of the Lords House and People unpoluted

your danger and dutie; Wishing, and hoping that the Lord
will incline your Royall heart, from the sence of the evil
which hath befallen You, through the slighting of former
Warning, to be more attentive unto this. We are very
sensible of your Majesties suffering, and low condition,
and do not in the least measure approve but from our hearts
abhorre any thing that hath been done to your Majesties
Person, contrary to the common resolutions of both Kingdoms:
Yet it shall be your Majesties wisdom, in this as in
all that hath befallen you these years past, to read the righteous
hand of the Lord, writing bitter things against you,
as for all your Provocations, so especially for resisting his
Work, and authorising by your Commissions the shedding
of the blood of his People, for which it is high time to
repent, that there be no more wrath against you and your
Realms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Commission of the preceding Assembly, whose
proceedings are unanimously approven by this Assembly,
Having read your Majesties Letter of the date at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Carisbrook</span></span>
Castle, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">December 27.</span></span> And perused your Concessions, did
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a name="Pg438" id="Pg438" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
finde some of these Concessions destructive to the Covenant,
and all or them unsatisfactorie, and did therefore emit a
Declaration concerning the same, least your Majesties Subjects
in this Kingdom should have unawares imbarked
themselves in an Engagement upon grounds not consisting
with the good of Religion, and the Solemn League and
Covenant. For preventing whereof, they did also present
most just and necessary desires unto the high and Honourable
Court of Parliament of this Kingdom; which, if they
had been granted, might have through the Blessing of God,
either procured (upon Treaty) your Majesties re-establishment,
and a solide Peace, or laid open the expedience and
necessity of a lawfull War, and have united this Kingdom
therein for the good of Religion, of your Majestie, and of
your Kingdoms. When the Parliament was pleased without
satisfaction to any of these desires, to go on towards
the determining of a War upon the grounds contained in their
Declaration, As many of their own Members who have
been faithfull in the Cause of GOD from the beginning,
did dissent from their preceedings, so most of all the Presbyteries
and Synods of this Kingdom, and the Committees
of War in severall Shires did by humble Supplication represent
to the Parliament, how unsatisfied they were in their
consciences concerning the present Engagement: Notwithstanding
of all which, the Engagement hath been carried
on without clearing either of the lawfulnesse or necessity
thereof. Therefore, We having now examined the same
by the Rule of Gods Word, and having found it unlawfull,
as we have warned the whole Kingdom of the danger thereof,
So we hold it our Duty also to warne your Majestie as
the Servants of the most High GOD, and in Name of the
Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span>, who must Judge the quick and dead, Earnestly
beseeching your Majestie that as ye would not draw
new guilt upon your Majesties Throne, and make these
Kingdoms again a field of Blood, you would be far from owning
or having any hand in this so unlawfull an Engagement;
Which as it hath already been the cause of so much sorrow
and many sufferings to the People of God in this Land, who
choose affliction rather then sin, So it tendeth to the undoing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Covenant and Work of Reformation: As we do
not oppose the restitution of your Majestie to the exercise of
your Royall Power; So we must needs desire that that
which is GODS be given unto Him in the first place, and
that Religion may be secured before the setling of any humane
interest; Being confident that this way is not only
most for the Honour of GOD, but also for your Majesties
Honor and Safety. And therefore as it was one of our Desires
to the High and Honourable Court of Parliament that
they would solicitie your Majestie for securing of Religion,
and establishing the Solemn League and Covenant in all your
Dominions, that your Majestie might know what they
intend on your behalf was with a subordination to Religion;
So we do now from our selves make this humble address
unto your Majestie, intreating your Majestie as you tender
Truth and Peace, you would be pleased to suffer your self
to be possessed with right thoughts of the League and Covenant,
and of the proceedings of your Majesties loyall
Subjects in relation thereunto, and give your Royall assent
for injoyning of it in all your Dominions. If your Majestie
had been pleased to hearken to our Counsell heranent some
years ago, the blood of many thousands, which now lyes
upon your Majesties Throne, might have been spared,
Popery, Prelacy, Idolatry, Superstition, Profanesse,
Heresie, Error, Sects, and Schismes which are now grown
to so great a height in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, might have been extirpate,
and your Majestie sitting in Peace in your own House, Reigning
over your Subjects with much mutuall contentment
and confidence. And if your Majestie shall yet search out
and repent of all your secret and open Sins, And after so
many dear-bought experiences of the danger of evill Counsell,
be now so wise as to avoid it, and to hearken to us
speaking unto you in the Name of the Lord, We are confident
by this means your Majestie may yet be restored, and
a sure and firme peace procured. We take it as a great
mercy, and as a door of hope, that God still inclines the
hearts of all his Servants to pray for your Majestie; And we
would not have your Majestie to look upon it as a light
thing, that you have been preserved alive, when many
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thousands have by your means and procurement fallen on
your right hand and on
your left hand. God forbid that your Majestie should any
longer dispise the word of exhortation, the riches of his
goodnesse, forbearance and long suffering, not knowing
that the goodnesse of God leads you unto Repentance;
For if your Majestie do so, As we are afraid, all
Counsels and Endeavours for your Majesties re-establishment
shall be in vain and without successe, because of the
Wrath of the Lord of Hosts, who brings down the mighty
from his Throne, and scatters the proud in the imaginations
of their hearts; So we shall mourn in secret for it, and for
all the miseries that are like to come upon your Throne and
your Dominions, and comfort our selves, in this, that
we have delivered our own souls. But we desire to hope
better things, and that your Majestie will humble your self
under the mighty hand of God, and be inclined to hearken
to the faithfull advise of his Servants, be willing to secure
Religion, and imploy your Royall Power for advancing
the Kingdom of the Son of God, which will turn as
well to the Honour and Happinesse of your Majesties as to
the Peace and Safety of your Subjects.

of their Repentance, who were not convinced of
their guiltinesse nor humbled for the same, but did thereafter
return with the dog to the vomit, and with the sow to
the puddle, unto the mocking of God, and the exceeding
great reproach and detriment of his Cause: Therefore, for
the better determining the Truth and sincerity of the Repentance
of those who desire to be admitted to the Covenant
and Communion: It is appointed and Ordained that none
of those persons who are debarred from the Covenant and
Communion shall be admitted and received thereto, but
such as after exact triall, shall be found for some competent
time before or after the offer of their Repentance, according
to the discretion of the respective Judicatories, to have
in their ordinary conversatione given real Testimony of their
dislike of the late unlawfull Engagement, and of the courses
and wayes of Malignants, and of their sorrow for their
accession to the same; &amp; to live soberly, righteously &amp; godly;
&amp; if any shall be found, who after the defeating of the Engagers
have uttered any Malignant speeches, tending to the
approbation of the late unlawful Engagement, or the blood-shed
within the Kingdome for promoving of the ends of the
said Engagement, or any other projects or practices within
or without the Kingdome; prejudiciall to Religion and the
Covenant, or tending to the reproach of the Ministry, or
the civill Government of the Kingdom, or who have unnecessarily
or ordinarily conversed with Malignant and disaffected
persons, Or who have had hand in, or accession to,
or compliance with or have any wayes countenanced or promoved
any Malignant Design, prejudiciall to Religion and
the Covenant; That these, notwithstanding their profession
of Repentance be not suddenly received, but a competent
time, according to the discretion of the Judicatory, be
assigned to them for tryall of the evidence of their Repentance,
according to the qualifications above mentioned.
And the Generall Assembly Ordains Presbyteries to make
intimation of this Act in the severall Kirks of their bounds so
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

I, after due consideration
of the late Warre against the Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>; And
having also considered the course pursued and promoted by
the Earle of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lanerk</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">George Monro</span></span> and
their Adherents in and about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stirling</span></span>, and by others in the late
Rebellion in the North, against all which not only eminent Testimonies of
Gods Wrath have been given in defeating of them, but
they were in themselves sinfull breaches of Covenant, and
preferring the interest of man unto God; I doe herefore in
Gods sight professe, that I am convinced of the unlawfulnesse
of all these ways, as contrary to the Word of God,
and to the Solemn League and Covenant, not only in regard
of the miscarriages of these that were imployed therein,
but also in respect of the nature of these courses themselves;
And therefore professing my unfained sorrow for my
guiltinesse by my accession to the same, doe renounce and
disclaim the foresaid Engagement and all the courses that
were used for carrying on the same, either before or after the
defeat of the Engagers, as contrary to the Word of GOD
and Solemn League and Covenant, and destructive to Religion
and the work of Reformation; And I doe promise
in the power of the Lords strength, never again to own any
of these or the like courses. And if hereafter at any time, I
shall be found to promote any Malignant Design or course,
that I shall justly be accompted a perfidious Covenant breaker
and despiser of God, and be proceeded against with the
highest Censures of the Kirk: Likeas I doe hereby promise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to adhere to the Nationall Covenant of this Kingdome
and to the Solemn League and Covenant betwixt the Kingdomes,
and to be honest and zealous for promoving all the
ends thereof, as I shall be called thereunto of God, and to
flee all occasions and temptations that may lead me into
any the like snares against the same.

The Lord who chooses Jerusalem in a furnace of Affliction,
hath been pleased since the beginning of the work
of Reformation in this Land, to exercise his People with
many trials; all that desired to keep a good conscience,
were not long agoe under many heavy and sad pressures
from the insolency and oppression of a prevailing party of
dis-affected and Malignant men, who under a pretext of
bringing the King to a condition of Honour, Freedom and
Safety, did carry on an unlawfull Engagement against the
Kingdom of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>: and if the Lord had not been mercifull
unto his people, they were like either to have been banished
out of the Land, or to have been kept in a perpetuall bondage
in their consciences, persons and estates: But he whose
Messengers those men had mocked, and whose word they
had despised, did bring them down suddenly in a day,
and restored liberty and peace unto his people: A mercy
and deliverance, which as it ought to be remembred with
thankfulnesse and praise, so may it engage our hearts not to
faint in troubles and straites that do yet abide us but to trust
in the name of the Lord, who both can and will deliver us
still out of all our afflictions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Albeit, wee do now enjoy many rich and precious blessing
wherin wee have reason to be comforted, and to rejoyce;
yet it were to shut our own eyes if we should not see our selves
involved in, and threatned with many and great dangers
at home and from abroad, it is matter of exceeding great
sorrow to think upon the ignorance and profanity, the impenitencie
and security that abounds still in the Land, notwithstanding
all the gracious dispensation of the Gospel, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means of grace in such purity and plenty, that none of the
Nations round about us can boast of the like, and of all his
sharp rods wherewith he hath afflicted us from year to year,
and of all the mercies and deliverances wherewith he hath
visited us, and of our late solemn confession of sinnes, and
engagement unto duties, sealed with the renewing of the
Covenant and the Oath of God; Which some men have so
far already forgotten, as to return with the dogge to the
vomit, and with the sow to the puddle: And many signes
of inconstancy and levity do appear among all sorts and
ranks of persons, who seem to want nothing but a sutable
tentation to draw them away from their stedfastnesse; Our
Army is not yet sufficiently purged, but there be still in it
Malignant and scandalous men, whose fidelity and constancy,
as it is much to be doubted, so is the wrath of the
Lord to be feared, upon their proceedings and undertakings,
without a speedy and effectuall remedy.

That prevailing party of Sectaries in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, who have
broken the Covenant, and despised the Oath of God, corrupted
the truth, subverted the fundamentall Government,
and taken away the Kings life look upon us with an evill
eye, as upon these who stand in the way of their monstruous
and new fangled devices in Religion and Government;
And though there were no cause to fear any thing from that
party but the Gangrene and infection of those many damnable
and abominable errours which have taken hold on them
yet our vicinity unto and daily commerce with that Nation,
may justly make us afraid that the Lord may give up many in
this Land unto a spirit of delusion to beleeve lies, because
they have not received the love of the truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither is the Malignant party so far broken and brought
low, as that they have abandoned all hopes of carrying on
their former designs against the Covenant and work of Reformation:
Beside many of them in this Kingdom, who
are as Foxes tied in chains, keeping their evill nature, and
waiting an opportuny to break their cords, and again to
prey upon the Lords people, there be standing Armies in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, under the command of the Marquesse of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ormond</span></span>, The Lord <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inchqueen</span></span>, the Lord of

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

by the Irish Rebels, upon many thousands of the English
and Scottish Nations in that land, have entred into a
Peace and Association with them, that they may the more
easily carry on the old designes of the Popish, Prelaticall
and Malignant party, And the Lord of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Airds</span></span>, and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">George Monro</span></span>, have by treachery and oppression brought the
Province of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ulster</span></span>, and Garrisons therein, under their power
and Command, and have redacted our country-men, and
such as adhere unto the Covenant, and cause of God in that
Province, unto many miseries and straits, and are like to
banish the Ministers of the Gospell, and to overturn these
faire beginnings of the work of God, which were unto many
a branch of hope, that the Lord meant to make <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span> a
pleasant land.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But which is more grievous unto us then all these, our
King notwithstanding of the Lords hand against his Fathers
opposition to the work of God, and of the many sad and
dolefull consequences followed thereupon, in reference to
Religion and his Sebjects, and to his person, and Government,
doth hearken unto the councels of these who were
Authors of these miseries to his Royall Father and his Kingdoms:
By which it hath come to passe, that his Majesty
hath hitherto refused to grant the just and necessary desires
of this Kirk and Kingdom, which were tendred unto him
from the Commissioners of both for securing of Religion,
the Liberties of the Subject, his Majesties Government,
and the Peace of the Kingdome; And it is much to be
feared that those wicked Counsellours may so farre prevaile
upon him in his tender yeers, as to engage him in a warre,
for overturning (if it be possible) of the work of God,
and bearing down all those in the three Kingdoms that adhere
thereto: Which if he shall doe, cannot but bring
great wrath from the Lord upon himselfe and his Throne,
and must be the cause of many new, and great miseries, and
calamities to these Lands.

It concerns a Nation thus sinfull and loaden with iniquity
and involved in so many difficulties and dangers, by timous
repentance and unfained humiliation to draw near to God,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a name="Pg453" id="Pg453" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and to wrastle with him in Prayer and Supplication, that
our sin may be pardoned, and our iniquity done away, and
that he would establish the Land in the love of the truth
and inable every one in their station to do their duty boldly
and without fear, and in humble dependance upon the
Lord, in whom alone is the salvation of his people; Every
man ought with all faithfulnesse and diligence, to make use
of all these means that are approven and allowed of God,
for preserving and carrying on of his work, and for securing
and guarding the Land against all enemies whatsomever,
both upon the right hand and upon the left.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Spirit of errour and delusion in our Neighbour Land,
in the policy of Satan hath vailed it self in many, under the
mask of holinesse and is in the righteous and wise dispensation
of God, armed with power, and attended with successe:
Therefore all the Inhabitants of this land would labour
for more knowledge, and more love of the truth,
without which they may easily be deceived, audled into
tentation, and would learn to distinguish betwixt the shew
and power of godlinesse. We know that there be many in
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> who be truly godly, and mourn with us for all the
errours and abominations that are in that land, But it is
without controversie, that that Spirit which hath acted in
the Courses and Counsels of these, who have retarded and
obstructed the work of God, dispised the Covenant, forced
the Parliament, murthered the King, changed the civill
Government, and established so vast a Toleration in Religion,
cannot be the Spirit of Righteousnesse and Holinesse,
because it teaches not men to live godly and righteously, but
drawes them aside into errour and make them to bring forth
the bitter fruits of impiety and iniquity and therefore ought
to be avoyded. And not only are such of our Nation as
travaile in our Neighbour-land, to take heed unto themselves
that they receive not infection from such as are leavened
with Errour, but these also who live at home, especially
in those places where Sectaries, upon pretext of
merchandise, and other civill imployments, ordinarily
traffique and converse. Neither needs any man to be afraid
of the power and successe of that party, Neither needs any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
man to be afraid of the power and successe of that party, they
who have gadded about so much to change their way, shall
ere long be ashamed; The Lord hath rejected their confidences,
and they shall not prosper in them; How farre they
may proceed in their Resolutions and Actings against this
Kingdome, is in the hand of the most high; If the Lord
shall suffer that party to invade this land, it may be the comfort
and incouragement of all the inhabitints thereof, that
not only hath that unlawfull engagement against the Kingdom
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> been declared against, and condemned both
by Kirk and State; but also that these men can pretend no
quarrell against us, unlesse it be, that we have adhered unto
the Solemn League and Covenant, from which they have
so foully revolted and backslidden; and that we have borne
testimony against Toleration, and their proceedings in reference
to Religion and Government, and the taking away of
the Kings life: And therefore we trust that in such a case
none will be so farre deficient in their duty as not to defend
themselves against such injust violence, and in the strength
of the Lord to adhere unto their former principles, with
much boldnes of spirit, and willingnesse of heart; In this
certainly we shall have a good conscience and the Lord shall
be with us.

We are not so, to have the one of our eyes upon the Sectaries,
as not to hold the other upon the Malignants, they
being an enemy more numerous, and no lesse subtile and
powerfull nor the other, and at this time more dangerous
unto us, not onely because experience hath proven that
there is a greater aptitude and inclination in these of our
Land, to complie with Malignants then Sectaries in that
they carry on their wicked designes under a pretext of being
for the King; But also because there be many of them in our
own bowels, and for that they doe pretend to be for maintenance
of the Kings Person and Authority, and (which is
the matter of our grife) because the King ownes their principles
and wayes; which if it be not taken heed unto, may
prove a great snare, and dangerous tentation to many as
side with them against the Lords people, and his cause.
The constant tenour of the carriage of these in this land, who
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stand for the Cause of God; are undeniable arguments of
their affection to Monarchy, and to that Royall Family and
Line wich hath sweyed the Scepter of this Kingdom for many
hundreds of yeers past. Albeit his Majestie who lately
reigned, refused to harken to their just desires, yet did they
with much patience and Moderation of mind, supplicate
and solicite his Majesty for satisfaction in these things that
concern Religion and the Covenant, and were still willing,
that upon satisfaction given, he should be admitted to the
exercise of his power; and whatsoever envie and malice objects
to the contrary, were carefull to get assurance concerning
the safety of His Majesties Person, when they brought
their Army out of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>; and when notwithstanding of that
assurance, the prevailing party of Sectaries were acting for
his life, did to the utmost of their power, endeavour by
their Commissioners that there might have been no such proceeding,
And when their desires and endeavours were not
successfull, did protest and bear testimony against the same.
And, as both Kirk and State had testified their tender respect
to his Majesty who now reigns, by their Letters written
to him whilst his Father was yet living, So no sooner did the
Parliament heare of his Fathers death, but they did with
all solemnity proclaim him King of these Kingdoms; And
after they had acquainted his Majesty by Messages with their
proceedings herein, Commissioners were sent both from
State and Kirk instructed with power and Commission to
expresse the affection of this Kingdome to Monarchy, and
his Majesties Person and Goverment, together with their
desires concerning the security of Religion, and the Peace
of those Kingdoms. And albeit the desires of both which
are now published to the world, with his Majesties answers
thereto, are such as are most just and necessary; yet the
Counsels of the malignant party had so great influence upon
his Majesty, that his answers are not only not satisfactory,
but short of that which was many times granted by his Royal
Father, and cannot be acquiesced unto, unlesse we would
abandon the League and Covenant, and betray Religion,
and the cause of God.

We hold it the duty of all who live in this Land, to wrestle
with God in the behalfe of the King, that he may be recovered
out of the snare of evill Counsell, and brought to give
satisfaction to the publick desires of Kirk and State; and in
their places and stations to use all endeavours with himselfe

But if his Majesty, or any having, or pretending power
and Commission from him, shall invade this Kingdom,
upon pretext of establishing him in the exercise of his Royal
power, as it will be an high provocation against GOD to be
accessory or assisting thereto, so will it be a necessary duty
to resist and oppose the same, We know that men are so
forgetfull of the oath of God, and ignorant of
the interest of Jesus Christ and the Gospel, and doe so little
tender that which concerns his Kingdom and the Privileges
thereof, and do so much dote upon absolute and Arbitrary
Government for gaining their own ends, and so much maligne

would admit his Majesty to the exercise of his Royal power
upon any termes whatsoever, though with never so much prejudice
to Religion, and the Liberties of these Kingdomes,
and would think it quarrell enough to make War upon all

1. That as Magistrates and their power is ordained of God,
so are they in the exercise thereof, not to walk according to

righteousnesse, as being the Ministers of GOD for the

2. There is ane mutuall Obligation and Stipulation betwixt
the King and his People; As both of them are tied to

of mutuall and reciprocall duties: According to
this, It is Satute and Ordained in the 8. Act of the 1. Parliament
of King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James</span></span> the 6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That all Kings, Princes or

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charles</span></span> at
his Coronation, and is inferred in our Nationall Covenant,
which was approven by the King who lately Reigned, As
long therefore as his Majesty who now Reignes, refuses to
hearken to the just and necessary desires of State and Kirk,
propounded to his Majesty for the Security of Religion,
and safety of his People, and to engage and oblige himself,
for the performance of his Duty to his People, It is consonant
to Scripture and reason and the Laws of the Kingdom,
that they should refuse to admit him to the exercise
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his Government, untill he give satisfaction in these

3. In the League and Covenant which hath been so solemly
sworne and renewed by this Kingdom, the Dutie of defending
and preserving the Kings Majesties Person and Authority
is joyned with, and subordinat unto the dutie of
preserving and defending the true Religion and Liberties of
the Kingdoms: And therefore his Majestie standing in opposition
to the just and necessary publick desires concerning
Religion and Liberties, it were a manifest Breach of Covenant,
and a preferring of the Kings interest to the interest
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span>, to bring him to the exercise of his Royal power,
which he, walking in a contrary way, and being compassed

4. Was not an Arbitrary Government and unlimited power,
the fountain of most of all the Corruptions both in
Kirk and State? And was it not for restraint of this, and for
their own just defence against Tyranny and injust violence,
which ordinarily is the fruit and effect of such a power, that
the Lords People did joyn in Covenant, and have been at
the expense of so much blood, pains and treasure these yeers
past? And if his Majestie should be admitted to the exercise
of his Government before satisfaction given, were it not
to put in his hand that Arbitrary Power, which we have
upon just and necessary grounds been so long withstanding,
and so to abandon our former Principles, and betrary our

5. The King being averse from the Work of Reformation
and the instruments thereof, and compassed about with Malignant
and disaffected men, whom he hearkens unto as his
most faithfull Counsellers, and looks upon as his best and
most Loyall Subjects, We leave it to all indifferent men to
judge, whether his Majestie, being admitted to the exercise
of his Power before satisfaction given, would not
by such Counsells endeavour an overturning of the things
which GOD hath wrought amongst us, and labour to
draw publick administrations concerning Religion and the
liberties of the Subject, unto that course and channall in

Reformation: Which we have the more cause to fear, because
his Royall Father did so often declare, that he conceived
himself bound to employ all the power that GOD
should put in his hands to the utmost for these ends; and
that he adheres as yet to his Fathers Principles, and walkes
in his way, and hath made a Peace with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Irish</span></span> Rebels,

6. It is no strange nor new thing for Kingdoms to preserve
Religion of themselves from ruine, by putting restraint
upon the exercise of the power and Government of those
who have refused to grant those things that were necessary
for the good of Religion, and the Peoples safety; There
have bin many precedents of it in this and other nations of
old, and of late. Upon these and other important considerations,
It shall be the wisdom of every one who dwell in the
Land, to take heed of such a temptation &amp; snare, that they be
not accessory to any such designes or endeavours, as they
would not bring upon themselves, and upon their families,
the guilt of all the detriment that will undoubtedly follow
thereupon to Religion and the Covenant, and of all the
miseries and calamities that it will bring upon his Majesties
Person and Throne, and upon these Kingdoms; Such a
thing would in all appearance be the undermining and shaking—if
not the overthrowing and destroying of the work
of Reformation: And therefore whosoever attempt the same,
oppose themselves to the Cause of GOD, and will at last
dash against the Rock of the LORDS Power, which
hath broken in pieces many high and lofty ones since the beginning
of this work in these Kingdoms: And it is unto
us a sure Word of Promise, That whosoever shall associate
themselves, or take counsel together, or gird themselves
against GOD and His Work, shall be broken in pieces.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not onely joyning in Arms with the Malignant partie,
that all these who would keep their integritie hath need
to beware of, but also subtil devices and designes, that are
promoted by fair pretexts and perswasions to draw men to
dispense at least with some part of these necessarie desires,
that are propounded to his Majestie for securing of Religion,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
After many turnings and devises the foundation of the unlawful
Engagement was at last laid by his Majesties Concessions
in the year 1648. Wherein though many things seemed
to be granted, yet that was denyed, without which Religion
and the Union betwixt the Kingdoms could not have
been secured: And it is probable, that such a way may be
assayed again, and prosecuted with very much cunning and
skill to deceive and insnare the simple. It doth therefore
concerne all ranks and conditions of persons to be the more
warie and circumspect, especially in that which concerns
the National Covenant, and the Solemn League and Covenant,
that before his Majestie be admitted to the exercise
of his Royal Power, that by and aftour the Oath of Coronation,
he shall assure and declare by his Solemn Oath under
his hand and seal his allowance of the National Covenant,
and of the Solemn League and Covenant, and obligation
to prosecute the ends thereof in his Station and Calling,
and that he shall for himself and his successours, consent
and agree to Acts of Parliament, injoyning the Solemn
League and Covenant, and fully Establishing Presbyterial
Government, the Directory of Worship, the Confession
of Faith and Catechisme, as they are approven by the General
Assembly of this Kirk and Parliament of this Kingdom,
in all his Majesties Dominions, and that he shall observe
these in his own Practice and Familie, and that he shall never
make opposition to any of these, nor endeavour any
change thereof. Albeit the League and Covenant be despised
by that prevailing party in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and the Work of
Uniformity, thorow the retardements and obstructions that
have come in the way, be almost forgotten by these Kingdoms,
yet the obligation of that Covenant is perpetual, and
all the duties contained therein are constantly to be minded,
and prosecute by every one of us and our posterity, according
to their place and stations: And therefore we are no
lesse zealously to endeavour, that his Majestie may Establish,
and swear, and subscribe the same, then if it were
unanimously regarded and stuck unto by all the Kingdom of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, for his Majestie swearing and subscribing the League
and Covenant, will much contribute for the Security of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Religion, his Majesties happinesse, and the Peace of his
Kingdoms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As it is incumbent to all, who live in this Kirk and Kingdom
to be watchful and circumspect, so it concerns these of
the High and Honourable Court of Parliament &amp; their Committees,
in a speciall way to see to their duty, &amp; to be straight
&amp; resolute in the performance of the same; Their former proceedings
is unto us a sufficient evidence and ground of hope,
that they will not be wanting in any necessary testimony of
dutie and Loyalty that they owe to the King, by using all
just and seasonable endeavoures for obtaining satisfaction of
his Majestie, that so he may be established upon his Thrones;
And we trust, that upon the other hand, the sense of
their obligations to God, and his Oath that is upon them,
will make them constantly to adhere to their former principles
resolutions, and desires concerning Religion and the Covenant,
that real satisfaction may be had thereanent, before
the King be put in the exercise of his power; And that
they will carefully provide for the safety of the Kingdom,
both in regard of the intestine dangers, and in regard of invasion
from without; It is not long since they together with the
rest of the Land, made solemn publick Confession of Compliance
with Malignants, carnal confidence, following
of self interests, and hearkening to the Counsels of flesh and
blood, and did in a special way engage themselves to comply,
and seek themselves and their own things no more,
to abandon the counsels of their own hearts, and not to rely
upon the Arm of flesh, and to purge Judicatories and Armies
from Profane and scandalous persons; And God forbid that
they should so soon forget, or neglect so necessary duties
and fall again unto so great and grievous transgressions. We
trust that they will seek the things of CHRIST, and not
their own things, that they will hearken to His Word, and
not walk in the imaginations of their own hearts, that they
will relie upon the Arm of the LORD, and not upon the
arm of flesh, that they will bewary and circumspect in
discerning the dispositions and affections of those whom
they put in trust, and that, seeing this Kingdom hath so much
smarted, &amp; been so often deceived by complyance with Malignants
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
they will carefully avoid this snare, inregard of those
who were upon the former unlawful Engagement &amp; be tender
in bringing in of such; And wee cannot but exhort them
in the Name of the LORD, to take notice of the Oppression
of the People and Commons in the Land, by the lawlesse
exactions of Land-Lords, Collectours and Souldiers. We do
not justifie the murmurings and grudgings of those, who,
preferring the things of the world to the Gospel and things
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span> repine at necessary burthens, without which
it is not possible that the Land can be secured from invasion
without and insurrection within, or the Cause and People
of GOD be defended from enemies: It is the duty
of every one who hath taken the Covenant, willingly and
with a cheerfull minde to bestow their means and their pains
as they shall be called thereunto, in an orderly way: Yet
should these to whom God hath committed the Government,
take carre that they be not needlessely burthened,
and that none grind their faces by oppression, not only by
making of Lawes against the same, but by searching out of
the cause of the poor, and by executing these Lawes timously
upon these that oppresse them, that they may find
real redresse of their just grievances and complaints, and be
encouraged to bear those burthens which cannot be avoyded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the Parliament have begun, so we hope they will
continue, to purge out all these from trust, that are not of
known integrity and affection to the cause of God, and of
a blamelesse and Christian conversation, and that they and
the officers of the Army in their respective places, will
seriously mind, and speedily and resolutely goe about the
removing from the Army all malignant scandalous persons,
and also the removing of Sectaries when any shall be found
therein, that they may give real evidence that they did not
deal deceitfully with God, in the day that they engaged
themselves thereto.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Albeit we hope and pray that those who beare charge in
our Army, will from the remembrance of the Lords goodnesse
to them, and the honour that he hath put upon them,
endeavour to carry themselves faithfully, and straightly,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Yet it cannot be unseasonable to warn them to take heed of
tentations, and to beware of snares that they be not drawn
to indifference or neutrality in the cause of God, much lesse
unto connivance at, or compliance with the courses and
designes of malignants or Sectaries, but to stick closely by
the same, and to be zealous against all the enemies and adversaries
thereof: And it concerns souldiers to be content
with their wages, and to doe violence to no man, but as
they are called unto the defence of the cause and people of
God, so to behave themselves in such a blamlesse and Christian
way, that their carriage may be a testimony to his
cause, and a comfort to his people; So shall our Armies
prosper, and the Lord shall goe out with them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But most of all it concerns the Ministers of the Gospel
whom God hath called to give warning to his people to look
to their duty; It is undeniably true, that many of the evils
wherewith this Kirk and Kingdome hath been afflicted in
our age, have come to passe because of the negligence of
some, and corruptions of others of the Ministry; Whilest
some fell asleep, and were carelesse, and others were covetous
and ambitious, the evil man brought in Prelacy, and
the Ceremonies, &amp; had farre promoted the Service-Book,
and the Book of Cannons; and the course of backsliding and
revolting was carried on, untill it pleased God to stirre up
the spirits of these few, who stood in the gap to oppose and
resist the same, and to begin the work of Reformation in
the Land; Since which time; the silence of some Ministers,
and compliance of others, hath had great influence
upon the backsliding of many amongst the people, who upon
the discovery of the evill of their way, complain that
they got not warning, or that if they were warned by some,
others held their Peace, or did justifie them in the course
of their backsliding; We can look upon such Ministers no
otherwise then upon those that are guilty of the blood of the
Lords people, and with whom the Lord will reckon for all
the breach of Covenant, and defection that hath been in the
Land. The Priests lips should preserve knowledge, and
they should seek the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger
of the Lord of Hosts; But such are departed out of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464" id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way, and hath caused many to stumble at the Law, therefore
hath the Lord made them contemtible and base before
all the people; acccording as they have not kept his wayes,
but have been partiall in his law; because they have lost
their savour, he hath cast out many of them as unsavoury
salt: But such as have been faithfull, as he hath preserved
from the violence and fury of men, so hath he verified his
word in their mouths, both against his enemies, and concerning
his people and his work; And makes them see,
though not all their desires concerning the Gospel, and the
work of God in the land yet very much of the fruit of their
labour, by preserving the doctrine and all the ordinances of
Jesus Christ in their purity, and adding in some measure
thereto the power and life thereof. We doe therefore
charge all the Ministers of the land, before God and the
Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead
at his appearing in his Kingdom, as in every thing to be ensamples
of a good conversation, and to walk without offence,
that the ministry be not blamed; So to take heed
unto the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made them
overseers, to declare unto them all the Counsell of God,
and to give them timous warning concerning every danger
and duty, and to hold forth unto them the solid grounds of
reall consolation, by which they may be encouraged and
comforted in all their trials and afflictions; that they may
be free of the blood of all men, and have this as a ground of
rejoycing, even the testimony of their consciences,
that in simplicity and godly purenesse, not with fleshly
wisdome, but by the grace of God they have had their conversation
in the world, and have exhorted and comforted
and charged every one committed unto them as a Father
doth his childrren. Especially, Ministers are
to be careful to be much indiscovering the temptations,
and pressing the duties of the times that these who are
under their charge may know what to avoid, and what
to embrace and pursue: If all the Watchmen in the Land
shall give warning, and blow the Trumpet at once, it shall
not be easie for enemies to prey upon the people of God.
Wee know no cause why any whom God hath called to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
preach the Gospel, should be afraid to speak boldly in the
Name of the Lord; since God hath given so manifest a testimony
of his care and protection, in preserving them, these
yeers past, who have striven to be faithfull to him who hath
called them from all the fury and malice of haters of the
work of God and of the Kingdom or of his Sonne Jesus Christ,
who hath promised to be with his servants unto the end of
the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Albeit the Land be involved in many difficulties, and
compassed about with great and iminent dangers, yet there
is hope and ground of consolation concerning this thing.
The Lord is in the midst of us, and we are called by his
name, our eares hear the joyfull sound of the Gospel, and
and our eyes see our Teachers; We behold the arms of the
Lord stretched out daily in working salvation for his people,
and answering their desires upon their enemies by terrible
things in righteousnesse; Although we be but few in number,
yet the Lord of Hosts is with us, and in the power of
his strenth we shall be able to prevaile. Although our land be
filled with sin, yet we have not been forsaken of the Lord
our God, but he hath alwayes had compassion upon us, and
delivered us in all our distresses; Although some of understanding
fall, it is but to try, and to purge and to make
white even to the end, because it is yet for a time appointed;
Although many cleave to us by flatteries, yet there be a
remnant who keep their integrity, and the Lord shall doe
good to these that be good, but such as turn aside to crooked
wayes, shall be led forth with the workers of iniquity.

The Lords people in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>, who adhere to

despair; they may be persecuted, but shall not be forsaken;
they may be cast down, but shall not be destroyed: And
although uniformity, and the work of Reformation in these
lands, seem not only to be retarded, but almost pluckt up
by the roots, and the foundation thereof razed; Yet the
seed which the Lord hath sowen there, shall again take
root downward, and bear fruit upward, The zeal of the
Lord of Hosts shall performe this.

integrity, and adhere to the Solemn League and Covenant,
together with the desire which we have to rectifie our Sympathie

as in us lieth that fellowship and correspondence that hath
been entertained betwixt the Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
these years past, do call upon us and constrain us not to be
silent in this day of their trouble and distress.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Albeit the Lord (who hath his fire in Zion, and his furnace
in Ierusalem) hath now for a long time past, afflicted
these Kingdoms with many &amp; sharp rods, and that his wrath
seems not yet to be turned away, but his hand stretched out
still; yet in all this, it becomes us who live in these lands
to stop our mouthes, neither can any impute iniquity to the
most High.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is rather a wonder, that any mercy should be continued,
and that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> are not cut off from being
Nations, seeing the back-slidings and provocations of both
has been so many and so grosse, Although the Solemn League
and Covenant was sworne and subscribed by both, yet
have many in both despised the Oath of GOD, as appears
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name="Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by the late unlawfull Engagement against the Kingdom of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, contrived and carried on by a prevailing party of
Malignants in this Land, and by the proceedings of the
Sectaries in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, in reference to Religion and Government.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We shall not insist upon what hath been the condition and
carriage of the Lords People in this Land in reference to the
late unlawfull Engagement: As we desire to magnifie the
power and loveing kindenesse of the Lord, who enabled all
the Judicatures of this Church, and a considerable part of
the Parliament, and the body of the Land, to dissent from,
and bear Testimony against the same, which made the House
of Commons in their Letter directed to the last Generall
Assembly or their Commissioners, to declare, that that
Engagement could not be looked on as a Nationall breach,
So we look upon it as a wonder of his Wisdom and Mercy,
that he hath disposed and directed the same for the furtherance
of his Work in our hand, and purging his House amongst
us. All this cometh forth from the Lord of Hosts,
who is wonderfull in Counsel and Excellent in Working.
Neither was it the least part of the lords goodnesse to us,
in that day of our strait that we were led in a plain path,
and kept from complyance with Sectaries on the one hand,
no less then with Malignants on the other. We have obtained
this mercy to be steadfast to our old principles, in
bearing free and faithfull Testimony against their proceedings,
both in reference to Toleration and Government,
and the taking away of the Kings life.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And as the danger and judgement which threatens the
Authors and Abettors of these things, doth affect our Spirits
with horrour, and maketh us desire that it may be given
to them of God to repent: So we should conceive our selves
void of Christian affection and compassion toward those
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, who suffer for the truth and Cause of God, if
we were not very sensible of all their present troubles and
calamities. It is no small grief to us, that the Gospel and
Government of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ</span></span> are so despised in that Land that
faithfull Preachers are persecuted and cryed down, that
Toleration is established by pretext of Law, and maintained
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Military power, and that the Covenant is abolished and buried
in oblivion. All which proceedings, cannot but be
looked upon as directly contrary to the Oath of God lying
upon us, and therefore cannot eschew his Wrath when he
shall come in Judgement, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to be a swift witnesse against those that
swear falsly by his Name.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These things are the more grievous to us, because (beside
many other wofull evils brought forth by them) they
have interrupted the building of the Lords House in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>;
the foundation whereof was laid by Oath and Covenant
with the most High God, and followed for some years
with many Declarations and Protestations of Faithfull adhering
thereto, and with great expense of blood and Treasure:
Which things were to all the godly in these Nations a
branch of hope, that the Lord would bring to perfection
the Work of Uniformity (so far advanced in all the parts
thereof) in these three Kingdoms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the great obstructions and sad interruptions that have
been made therein, by the strange and unexpected practises
of many now in place and power in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, are to all the
welaffected in both Kingdoms, and in all the Churches abroad,
the mater of their sorrow and humiliation. And if
there be any place left for admonition, we Warn such as
have forgotten the Covenant, and despised the Oath of God,
and turned aside to lies and errour, to consider whence they
are fallen, and to repent. Prosperity and success for a time
are no warrantable evidences of a good Cause, nor sufficient
guards against the wrath of God; It is no good use of
the Lords mercy for such men under pretext of Liberty to
make both themselves and others slaves to corruption, and
to make all men both in Church and State like the fishes of
the Sea, or the creeping things that have no ruler over them.
Are these things according to the Word of God, and the
pattern of the best Reformed Churches? Or is that the endeavour
to bring the three Kingdoms to the nearest uniformity
that may be in Doctrine, Worship, Government, and
Discipline; Or is that the maintaining of the union betwixt
the three Kingdomes, when the straitest bond thereof is utterly
dissolved and quite taken away, and the fundamentall
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg 474]</span><a name="Pg474" id="Pg474" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Government by King and Parliament wholly overturned;
The just God who is of pure eyes beholds these things, and
shall with no lesse fury and indignation break the horn of
these men, then he hath broken the power, and brought
down the pride of Malignants before them, if repentance
prevent not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Amidst these sors and griefes it is unto us matter of rejoycing,
that there be many in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> who mourn for all
these abominations, and labour to keep their garments pure
by refusing to comply with that course of backsliding, and
by bearing testimony against the same. And we hope the
expectation of such, shall not be disappointed, but that the
Lord will open to them a doore for carrying on of
his work, and making the lying spirit to passe out of that
land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And albeit many think no otherwise of the Covenant and
work of Reformation, then as a mean to further their own
ends; yet we are confident, that none who holds fast their
integrity, have so learned Christ, but are carefull to make
conscience of the oath of God lying on them; And we are
sure (whatever be the base thoughts and expressions of backsliders
from the Covenant) it wants not many to own it in
those Kingdomes, who (being called thereto) would seale
the same with their blood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although there were none in the one Kingdome who did
adhere to the Covenant, yet thereby were not the other
Kingdom nor any person in either of them absolved from
the bond thereof, since in it we have not only sworne by the
Lord, but also covenanted with him. It is not the failing
of one or more that can absolve others from their duty or tye
to him; Besides, the duties therein contained, being in
themselves lawfull, and the grounds of our tye thereunto
moral, though others do forget their duty, yet doth not
their defection free us from that obligation which lyes upon
us by the Covenant in our places and stations. And the
Covenant being intended and entred into by these Kingdoms,
as one of the best means of stedfastnesse, for guarding
against declining times; It were strange to say that the
back-sliding of any should absolve others from the tye thereof,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
especially seeing our engagement therein is not only
nationall, but also personall, every one with uplifted
hands swearing by himselfe, as it is evident by the tennor of
the Covenant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From these and other important reasons, it may appear
that all these Kingdomes joyning together to abolish that oath
by law, yet could they not dispense therewith; Much lesse
can any one of them, or any part in either of them doe the
same. The dispensing with oathes hath hitherto been abhorred
as Antichristian, and never practised and avowed
by any, but by that man of sin; therefore those who take
the same upon them, as they joyn with him in his sin, so
must they expect to partake of his plagues.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As we shall ever (God willing) be mindfull of our duty to
the faithfull that adhere to the Covenant in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, having
them alwayes in our hearts before the Lord, so we desire to
be refreshed with their singlesse and boldnesse in the cause of
God, according to their places. This is the time of their
triall, and the houre of tentation among them; blessed shall
they be who shall be found following the Lamb, and shall
not be ashamed of his testimony. We know in such dark houres,
many are drawne away with the multitude, whom the
Lord will again purge and make white; And we doubt not
but many such are in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, whom the bold clear preaching
of Christ may reclaim; Much therefore lieth upon the
Watch-men all this time, that their Trumpet may give a certain
and distinct sound, warning and exhorting every one, as
those that must give account; And blessed shall those servants
be, who shall be found faithfull in their Lords house, distributing
to his houshold what is meet for this season, and can
say they are free of the blood of all men, having shewen them
the whole Counsell of God, being in nothing terrified of
the threats of their adversaries; And blessed &amp; happy shall that
people be, that walk in the light holden forth by them, and
staye upon the Lord in this dark time, harkning to the voyce
of his servants, &amp; walking in the light of his word &amp; not in
the sparks of their owne kindlings, which will end in sorrow.
How inexcusable will <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span> be, having so foulie revolted
against so many faire testimionies, which the Lord Christ hath
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg 476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
entred as Protestations to preserve his right, in these ends
of the earth long since given unto him for his possession, and
of late confirmed by Solemne Covenant. Christs right to
these Kingdomes is surer then that he should be pleaded out
of it by pretended liberty of Conscience, and his begun possession
is more precious to him, then to be satisfied with a
dishonourable toleration. All that yet we have seen, doth
not weaken our confidence of the Lords glorifying the house
of his glory in these lands, and of his sonnes taking unto
him his great power, and reigning in the beauty and power
of his Ordinances in this Island. His name is wonderfull,
and so also are his workes, we ought not therefore to square
them according to our line, but leave them to
him, who hath the government laid upon his shoulder, all
whose wayes are judgement, &amp; whose ruling these Kingdoms
had never yet reason to decline. It is good for us to be stedfast
in our duty, and therein quietly to wait and hope for the salvation
of God. The word of promise is sure, (and hath an
appointed time) that he that will come shall come and will
not tarry. There is none hath cause to distrust the Lords
word to his people; It hath often to our experience been
tryed in the fire, and hath ever come forth with a more glorious
lustre. Let not therefore these that suffer in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>
cast away their confidence, they are not the first who have
needed patience after that they had done the Lords will. But
let them strengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble
knees, and say to the fearfull in heart, be strong, fear not,
behold your God will come with vengeance, even God
with a recompence, he will come and save you. Now the
just shall live by faith, whereas these that draw back, or
become lukewarm in the Lords work, his soul shall abhorre
them, and he shall spue them out of his mouth, But
we perswade our selves of better things of these our brethren
in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">England</span></span>, and prayeth that the God of Peace who brought
again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepheard
of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant,
may make them perfect in every good work to doe
his will, working in them that which is well pleasing in his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg 477]</span><a name="Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fight through Jesus Christ, to whom be Glory for ever.
AMEN.

Wee your Majesties most humble and Loyall Subjects,
the Commissioners from all the Presbyteries in this
your Majesties ancient Kingdome, and members of this
present Nationall Assembly, Having expected to finde at
our meeting, a gracious and Satisfactory returne to those
humble representations made to your Majestie at the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hague</span></span>,
by the Commissioners of this Kirk, cannot but expresse
our great sorrow and griefe, that your Majesties
goodnes has been so far abused, As that not only the just
and necessary desires presented by them to your Majestie,
which so much concerne the glory of God, your owne
honour and happinesse, the peace and safety of your Kingdomes,
are utterly frustrated, as wee perceive by the paper
delivered in answer to them; but also this Assembly
hath not received so much as any signification by letter
of your Majesties minde: Which princely condescension
had not wont to be wanting in your Royall Father, to former
Generall Assemblyes, even in times of greatest distance.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a name="Pg481" id="Pg481" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our witnesse is in heaven, and record on high, that wee
are not conscious to our Selves of any undutifull thought or
disloyall affection, that might have procured this at your
Majesties hands; And that, as wee doe from our hearts
abominate and detest that horrid fact of the Sectaryes against
the life of your Royall Father our late Soveraigne, So it is
the unfained and earnest desire of our soules, that the Ancient
Monarchicall government of these Kingdoms, may
be established and flourish in your Majesties person all the
dayes of your life, and be continued in your royall Family
which by divine providence hath without interruption
raigned over us and our predecessors for so many Generations
since the time that we were a Kingdom, And that
there is nothing under the glory of God, and cause of our
Lord Jesus Christ, for which wee doe more heartily solicit
the throne of grace, Or would more readily expose
unto hazard all that is deare to us in the world, then for
this. And now though this very great discouragement
might incline us to hold our peace at this time, Yet the
tendernesse and uprightnesse of our affection and Love to
your Majesties happinesse (which many waters cannot
quench) together with the Conscience of our duty which
Our Lord and Master has laid upon us, in this our place
and station, constraineth us, yea, and your Majesties owne
goodnesse and gracious disposition, whereof the late Commissioners
have given us so Large a testimony, Doth much
encourage us, to renew our addresses to your Majestie in
this humble faithfull representation, both of the great and
growing dangers to your Royall person and Throne, and
of these duties, which the Lord of Lords and King
of Kings, call for from you, as you would look to finde
favour in his eyes, and to be delivered out of your deepe
distresses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our hearts are filled with fears and troubles, in your
Majesties behalf, when we look upon the sad calamities
which have been already produced by such wayes and courses,
as we perceive your Majestie is entred, and in danger
to be further led away into, by the prevalency of evill Councell
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
upon your tender age: Particalarly, Your refusing to
give satisfaction to the just and necessary desires of the people
of God, for advancing the work of Reformation of
Religion, and establishing and securing the same in your
Majesties Dominions, which is nothing else, but to oppose
the Kingdome of the Sonne of God, by whom Kings
doe raigne, and to refuse that he should raigne over you and
your Kingdomes in his pure Ordinances of Church government
and Worship; Your cleaving unto these men as your
trustiest Counsellors, who, as they never had the glory of
God, nor good of his people before their eyes, so now in all
their wayes and Counsels, are seeking nothing but their owne
interests, to the hazard of the utter subversion of your
Throne, the ruine of your Royall Family, and the desolation
of your Kingdomes; Your owning the practises,
and intertaining the Person of that flagicious man, and most
justly excommunicate Rebell, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">James Graham</span></span>, who has exercised
such horrid cruelty upon your best Subjects in this
Kingdom, which cannot but bring upon your Throne, the
guiltinesse of all the innocent blood shed by him and his
Complices; and above all, that, which we cannot think
upon without trembling of heart and horrour of spirit,
Your setling of late such a Peace with the Irish Papists the
Murderers of so many thousands of your Protestant Subjects,
whereby not only they are owned as your good Loyall
Subjects, but also there is granted unto them (contrary
to the Standing Lawes of your Royall Progenitors, contrary
to the commandment of the most high God, and to
the high contempt and dishonor of his Majestie, and evident
danger of the Protestant Religion) a full liberty of their
abominable Idolatry; which cannot be otherwise judged,
but a giving of your Royal power and strength unto the
beast, and an accession to all that blood of your good Subjects,
wherewith those Sonnes of Babell have made that
Land to swim.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We do in all humility beseech your Majestie to consider &amp;
lay to heart what the mouth of the Lord of Hosts hath spoken
of all the accompts of People, Nations, Kings, and Rulers against
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page483">[pg 483]</span><a name="Pg483" id="Pg483" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the Kingdom of his Son, that they imagine a vaine thing
and that he that sitteth in heaven will have them in dirision
and vex them in his sore displeasure. Consider, how he hath
blasted and turned upside downe these yeares by past, all the
devices and plots of those men that now beare the Swey in
your Majesties Counsels: Consider, how the anger of God has
been kindled, even against his dearest Saints, when they have
joyned themselves to such men as he hateth and has cursed:
Consider, how severely hee hath threatned and punished
such Kings as have associate with Idolaters, and leaned unto
their helps. Surely, great is the wrath of God, whereof you
are in danger; And yet the Lord in the riches of his goodnesse,
forbearance and long suffering, is waiting to be gracious
to your Majestie; To day if ye will hear his voice, harden
not your heart, but humble your self under the mighty
hand of God, lamenting after him as, for the iniquities of
your Fathers house, especially the opposition against the reformation
of Religion and Cause of God, the permitting
and practising Antichristian Idolatry in the Royall Family
it self, and the shedding of so much blood of the people of
God, so also, for your owne entering to walke in the like
courses in the beginning of your raign. It is high time to
fall downe before the Throne of grace, seeking to get your
peace made with God through Jesus Christ whose blood is
able to wash away all your sins, To walk no longer in the
Councel of the ungodly, nor cleave to such as seeke their
own things and not the things of Jesus Christ, nor the welfare
of your Subjects and Government, but to set your eyes
upon the faithfull in your dominions, that such may dwell
with you, &amp; be the men of your Councells, To serve the Lord
in feare, and kisse the Sonne of God, by a sincere and cordiall
contributing your Royall allowance and authority, for
establishing in all your dominions the reformation of Religion,
in Doctrine, Worship, and Government as it is now agreed
upon according to the cleare &amp; evident warrant of the
word of God, by the Assembly of Divines at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Westminster</span></span>, and
the Generall Assemblies of this Church; And also, laying
aside that service book, which is so stuffed with Romish
corruptions, And conforming your owne practise and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worship of God in your Royall Family, to that Gospell
simplicity and purity which is holden forth from the word
of God, in the Directory of worship, and not only to grant
your Royall approbation to the Covenant of these three
Kingdomes (without which, your people can never have
from you sufficient security, either for Religion, or their
just liberties) but also your selfe to joyne with your people
therein as the greatest security under Heaven for your person
and just greatness, and to cause all of them stand to it by
your Royall Command, according to the practise of that
gracious King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Josiah</span></span>, to whom, wee wish your Majestie
in these your younger yeares, and this beginning of your
raigne, to look as to an ensample and Kingly portract approven
of God. These things if your Majestie do; As wee
are well assured, that the hearts of all your good Subjects in
these Kingdomes will be enlarged with all cheerfulnesse to
imbrace your person, and submit unto your Royall Government,
so wee darre promise in the Name of our Lord, that
you shall finde favour with God, peace and joy unspeakable
and full of glory to your Soule, and deliverance out of your
sad afflictions and deep distresses in due time: But if your
Majestie shall go on in refusing to hearken to wholesome
Councels; We must for the discharge of our Conscience
tell your Majestie in the humility and griefe of our hearts,
that the Lords anger is not turned away, but his hand
stretched out still against you and your Family. But we hope
and shall with all earnestnesse and constancy pray for better
things from, and to your Majestie: And whatsoever misconstruction
(by the malice of those that desire not a right
understanding and cordiall conjunction between your Majestie
and this Kirk and Kingdome) may be put upon our
declaration; Yet wee have the Lord to be our witnesse,
that our purpose and intention therein is no other, but to
warne and keepe the people of God committed to our care,
that they runne not to any course which would bring upon
themselves the guilt of highest perjury and breach of Covenant
with God, and could not but prove most dangerous
to your Majestie and your Government, and involve you in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id="Pg485" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shedding the blood of those who are most desirous to preserve
your Majesties Person, and just right in all your dominions.
And now wee doe with all earnestnes beseech
your Majestie, that you will follow the courses of truth and
peace; And that when there is a doore opened for your
Majestie to enter to your Royall Government over us, in
peace, with the favour of God, and cordiall Love and
imbracings of all your good Subjects, You will not suffer
your selfe to be so farre abused and misled by the Councels
of men, who delight in war, as to take away of violence
and blood, which cannot but provoke the most high against
your Majestie, and alienat from you the hearts of your
best Subjects, who desire nothing more, than that your
Majestie may have a long and happy raign over them, And
that they may live under you, a peaceable and quiet life, in
all Godlinesse and honesty.

Our Concern for the Good of Our Ancient Kingdom,

Differences as to the Government of the Church have

willingly concurre with Our Parliament, in In-acting
such a Frame of it, as was judged to be most agreeable
to the Inclinations of Our Good Subjects: To which
as We have had a particular Regard, in Countenanceing
this Assembly, With Our Authority, and a Representative
of Our Royall Person; So We expect, that
Your Managment shall be such, as We shall have no
reason, to Repent of what we have done. A Calm and
Peaceable Procedure, will be no less pleasing to Us,
than it becometh You. We never could be of the
Mind, that Violence was suited to the advancing of
True Religion; Nor do We intend, that Our Authority
shall ever be a Tool, to the irregular Passions of
any Party. Moderation is what Religion enjoynes,
Neighbouring Churches expect from You, and We
Recommend to You. And We assure You of Our constant
Favour and Protection, in Your following of
these Methods, which shall be for the real advantage
of True Piety, and the Peace of Our Kingdoms. Given

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Your Gracious Letter, Direct to the Ministers and
Elders met here, in the General Assembly of the
Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span> was Read and Heard among Us,
with all Joy and Thankfulness, that the Rising and
Shining again of the Royal Favour, upon this long
Afflicted and distressed Church, could possibly Inspire:
For as Your Majesties Concern for the Good of this
Your Ancient Kingdom, hath indeed been such, as
nothing can impair the Happy State whereunto You
have Restored it, save the want of the due sense and
understanding of so great a Mercy; So We doe most
heartily acknowledge, that through Your Majesties
Care and Kindness, the Church of Christ therein, doth
equally partake of the same Blessing. It was the sad Confusions,
that differences as to the Government of the
Church, had caused in this Nation, that according to
Your Majesties first Declaration, for our Relief, moved
our Gracious God, to Raise up and Prosper You, to
Be our Glorious Deliverer, for Effectuating the Reestablishment
that we now enjoy: So that we are perswaded,
that it is not more Agreeable, to the Inclinations
and Conscientious Perswasions of all within this
Kingdom, who are best Affected to Your Majesties
Person and Government, than it is acceptable to God,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a name="Pg506" id="Pg506" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and will be Your Majesties perpetual Peace and Satisfaction.
Nor are we less Sensible of the particular Regard,
Your Majestie professeth towards us, on this occasion,
in Countenancing this Assembly, with Your
Authority, and a Representative of Your Royal Person;
for which we most humbly acknowledge Your
Gracious Favour; especially that it hath pleased Your
Majesty, to fix Your Choice, upon a Person so well
Qualified, and so acceptable to Us. And now, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
Sir</span></span>, after so many and so great Mercies and Favours,
Received from God and Your Majesty; We Hope we
may with Confidence assure You, that our Managment
shall be such, as Your Majesty hath so just Reason
to expect, and shall never give you cause to Repent
of what You have done for Us. The God of Love, the
Prince of Peace, with all the Providences that have
gone over Us, and Circumstances that We are under,
as well as Your Majesties most obliging Pleasure, Require
of Us a Calme and Peaceable Procedure, And if
after the Violence for Conscience sake, that We have
Suffered, and so much Detested, and these Grievious
Abuses of Authority, in the late Reigns, Whereby
through some Mens Irregular Passions, We have so
sadly Smarted; We our selves, should Lapse into the
same Errours, We should certainly prove the most
Unjust towards God, Foolish towards our Selves, and
Ungrate towards Your Majesty, of all Men on earth.
Great Revolutions of this nature, must be attended,
with Occasions of Complaint: And even the worst of
Men, are Ready to cry out of Wrong, for their justest
Deservings: But as Your Majesty Knows these things
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
too well, to give us the least Apprehension of any impressions
evil Report can make; So We assure Your
Majesty, as in the Presence of God, and in expectation
of his dreadfull Appearance, that We shall Study
that Moderation, which Your Majesty Recommends,
as being convinced, that it is the Duty that Religion
enjoyns, and Neighbouring Churches doe most justly
expect from Us: Desiring in all things, to Approve
our selves unto God, as the true Disciples of Jesus
Christ, who, though most Zealous, against all Corruptions
in his Church, was most Gentle towards the
Persons of Men: And to maintain as much as in us lyes,
Peace and Concord with all the Reformed Churches:
As likewise to comply in all obsequious Duty, with all
that Your Majesty enjoynes, for the Real Advantage
of true Piety, and the Peace or all Your Kingdoms.
Heartily wishing, that God, who hath Graciously
brought back Your Majesties Person, in Safety, from
Your Late, no less Generous, than Dangerous Expedition,
for his Cause and Truth, with joyfull Success;
May still preserve Your Majesty, and Our most Gracious
Queen; Granting You long Life, Health, and
Prosperity, And may Establish Your Throne, and
Bless Your Government, to the Glory of His Great
Name, the Good of all his Churches, and the welfare
of all Your People. Which shall ever be the earnest
Prayer of,

subject Themselves, their Lives and Doctrine, to
the Cognizance of the Respective Judicatories of
this Church, and equally to Oppose Schism and Defection,
in any Capacity, that they should be capable
of. But the said Committee, Judgeth, the Reading
of the larger of the saids two Papers, in full Assembly,
to be Inconvenient: In regard, That
though there be several good Things in it, yet the
same doth also contain, several Peremptory and gross
Mistakes, Unseasonable and Impracticable Proposals,
and Uncharitable and Injurious Reflections, tending
rather to kindle Contentions, than to compose
Divisions: Nevertheless, the said Committee, gives it
as their Opinion, That the foresaid Offer of the above
named Persons their Subjection and Obedience, to
the Authority of this Church, in her Respective Judicatories,
contained in the said Shorter Paper;
should be Entertained and Accepted of, by the Assembly,

the Causes thereof.</span></span></h3>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The General Assembly, Having taken into their
most serious Consideration, the late great and
general Defection of this Church and Kingdom; Have
though fit to Appoint a Day of Solemn Humiliation
and Fasting, for Confession of Sins, and making Supplication
to Our Gracious GOD, to Forgive and Remove
the guilt thereof; In order whereunto, they have
Ordained the Confession of Sins, and Causes of Fasting
following, to be duely Intimate and Published; Recommending
it most earnestly to all persons, both Ministers
and Others, That every One of us may not only
search and try our own Hearts and Wayes, and stir up
Ourselves to seek the Lord; But also in our Stations,
and as we have access, Deal with one another, in all
Love and Tenderness, to prepare for so great and necessary
a Duty, that we may find mercy in God's sight,
and He may be graciously Reconciled to our Land in
the Lord Jesus, and take delight to dwell among us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Although our gracious God hath of late, for His
own Name sake wrought great and wonderful things,
for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Britain</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ireland</span></span>,
and for this Church and Nation
in particular; Yet the Inhabitants thereof have cause
to remember their own evil wayes, and to loath themselves
in their own sight for their Iniquities. Alas!
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Alas! We and our Fathers, our Princes, our Pastors,
and People of all Ranks have sinned, and have been under
great Transgression to this day: For though our
gracious God shewed early kindness to this Land, in
sending the Gospel among us, and afterward in our Reformation
from Popish Superstition and Idolatry; and
It had the Honour, beyond many Nations of being
after our first Reformation, Solemnly devoted unto
God, both Prince and People; yet we have dealt treacherously
with the Lord, and been unstedfast in His Covenant,
and have not walked suitably to our Mercies
received from Him, nor obligations to Him. Through
the mercy of God this Church had attained to a great
purity of Doctrine, Worship and Government, but
this was not accompanied with suitable personal Reformation,
neither was our Fruit answerable to the pains
taken on us by Word and Work; We had much Gospel-preaching,
but too little Gospel-practice, too many
went on in open wickedness, and some had but a form
of Godliness, denying the power thereof: Many also
who had the Grace of God in truth fell from their first
love, and fell under sad languishings and decays; and
when for our sins the Anger of the Lord had divided us,
and we were brought under the feet of strangers, and
many of our brethren killed, and others taken captive
and sold as slaves; yet we sinned still, and after we
were freed from the yoak of strangers, instead of returning
to the Lord, and being led to Repentance by
His Goodness, the Land made open Defection from
the good ways of the Lord: Many behaved as if they
had been delivered to work abomination, the flood-gates
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a name="Pg521" id="Pg521" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Impiety were opened, and a deluge of wickednese
did overspread the Land. Who can without grief
and shame remember the shameful debauchery and
drunkenness that then was? And this accompanied
with horrid and hellish cursing and swearing, and followed
with frequent Filthiness, Adulteries and other
Abominations, and the Reprover was hated, and he
that departed from Iniquity made himself a Reproach
of Prey. And when by these, and such like corrupt
practices, mens Consciences were debauched, they proceeded
to sacrifice the Interest of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and priviledges of his Church to the lusts and will of
Men; The Supremacy was advanced in such a way,
and to such an height, as never any Christian Church
acknowledged; The Government of the Church was
altered, and Prelacie (which hath been always grievous
to this Nation) introduced, without the Churches
consent, and contrary to the standing Acts of our National
Assemblies, both which the present Parliament
hath (blessed be God) lately found; And yet nevertheless,
of the then standing Ministry of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, many
did suddenly and readily comply with that alteration of
the Government, some out of Pride and Covetousness,
or Man-pleasing, some through infirmity or weakness,
or fear of Man, and want of Courage and Zeal for God;
many faithful Ministers were thereupon cast out, and
many Insufficient and Scandalous Men thrust in on
their Charges, and many Families ruined, because they
would not own them as their Pastors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And alas! It is undenyable, there hath been under
the late Prelacie, a great decay of Piety, so that it was
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enough to make a man be nicknam'd a Phanatick, if he
did not run to the same excess of Riot with others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And should it not be lamented, for it cannot be denied,
that there hath been in some a dreadful Atheistical
Boldness against God, some have disputed the Beeing of
GOD, and His Providence, the Divine Authority of
the Scriptures, the Life to come, and Immortality of
the Soul, yes and scoffed at these things.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There hath been also an Horrid Prophanation of the
Holy and Dreadful Name of GOD, by cursing and
swearing: Ah! there hath been so much Swearing
and Forswearing amongst us, that no Nation under
Heaven hath been more guilty in this than we; some
by swearing rashly or ignorantly, some falsly, by breaking
their Oaths. And imposing and taking ungodly unlawful
Oaths and Bonds, whereby the Consciences of
many have been polluted and seared, and many ruined
and oppressed for refusing and not taking them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There hath also been a great neglect of the worship
of God, too much in publick, but especially in Families
and in secret.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The wonted care of Religious sanctifying the Lord's
Day is gone, and in many places the Sabbath hath been
and is shamefully prophaned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Land also hath been, full of bloody Crimes,
and Cities full of Violence, and much innocent Blood
shed, so that Blood touched Blood, yea, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sodoms</span></span> sins
have abounded amongst us. Pride, fulness of Bread,
Idleness, Vanities of Apparel, and shameful sensuality
filled the Land.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And Alas! how great hath been the Cry of Oppression
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page523">[pg 523]</span><a name="Pg523" id="Pg523" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and Unrighteousness, Iniquity hath been established
by a Law, there hath been a great perverting
of Justice, by making and executing unrighteous Statutes
and Acts, and sad persecutions of many for
their Conscience towards God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is also matter of Lamentation, that under this
great Defection, there hath been too general a fainting
not only amongst Professours of the Gospel, but also
amongst Ministers; yea, even amongst such, who in
the main things did endeavour to maintain their Integrity,
in not giving seasonable and necessary Testimony
against the Defections and Evils of the Time, and
keeping a due distance from them, and some on the
other hand managed their Zeal with too little Discretion
and Meekness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is also matter of Humiliation, that when Differences
fell out amongst these, who did own Truth, and bear
witness against the Course of Defection, they were
not managed with due Charity and Love, but with too
much heat and bitterness, injurious Reflections used
against Pious and Worthy men on all hands, and scandalous
Divisions occasioned, and the Success of the
Gospel greatly obstructed thereby, and some dangerous
Principles drunk in: And after all this, there were
shameful advances towards Popery, the abomination
of the Mass was set up in many places, and Popish
Schools erected, and severals fell to Idolatry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And though the Lord hath put a stop to the Course
of Defection, and of his great mercy given us some
reviving from our Bondage; yet we have sad cause to
regrate and bemoan, that few have a due sense of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a name="Pg524" id="Pg524" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mercy, or walk answerable thereto; Few are turned to
the Lord in truth, but the wicked go on to do wickedly;
And there is found amongst us to this day, shameful
ingratitude for our mercies, Horrid impenitency under
our sins, yea, even among those, who stand most
up for the defence of the Truth: And amongst many
in our Armies, there is woful Prophanness and Debauchery.
And though we profess to acknowledge, there
can be no Pardon of Sins, no Peace and Reconciliation
with God, but by the Blood of Jesus Christ; Yet few
know Him, or see the Necessity and Excellency of the
Knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ; few see their need
of him, or esteem, desire, or receive him as he is offered in
the Gospel; few are acquainted with Faith in Jesus
Christ, and living by Faith in Him, as made of the Father
unto us, wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and
Redemption; And few walk as becometh the Gospel, and
imitate our Holy Lord in Humility, Meekness, Self-denial,
Heavenly mindedness, Zeal for GOD, and Charity
towards Men: But as there is even untill now, a great
contempt of the Gospel, a great Barrenness under it; So
a deep Security under our sin and Danger, a great want
of Piety toward God, and Love towards Men, with a
woful Selfishness, every one seeking their own things,
few the things of Christ, or the publick Good, or one
anothers welfare: And finally, the most part more ready
to Censure the sins of others, than to Repent of their own.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Our Iniquities are increased over our Heads, and
our Trespasses are grown up unto the Heavens, they
are many in number, and hainous in their nature, and
grievously aggravated, as having been contrary to

great Light and Love, under signal Mercies and Judgments,
after Confession and Supplication, and notwithstanding
of our Profession, Promises and solemn Vowing,
and Covenanting with God to the contrary.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Have we not then sad cause of deep Sorrow and Humiliation?
And may we not fear, if we do not repent,
and turn from the evil of our wayes, and return to the
Lord with all our hearts, that he return to do us evil,
after He hath done us good, and be angry with us,
until he hath consumed us?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us therefore humble our selves by fasting and
Praying, let us search out our sins, and consider
our wayes, and confess these, and other our sins, with
Sorrow and Detestation; Let us Turn unto the Lord
with fasting and weeping, and with mourning; Let
us firmly resolve and sincerely Engage to amend our
wayes and doings, and return unto the Lord our God,
with all our hearts, and earnestly pray, that for the
Blood of the Lamb of God, our sins may be forgiven,
and our back slidings healed, and we may yet become
a Righteous Nation, keeping the Truth, that Religion
and Righteousness may flourish, and Love and
Charity abound, and all the Lords People may be of
one mind in the Lord: And in order to all these, that
the word of the Lord may have free course, and be
glorified, and that the Preaching of the Word, and
Dispensing of the Sacraments, may be accompanied
with the wonted Presence, Power and Blessing of the
Spirit of the Lord, That the Lord would Preserve and
bless our gracious <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Queen</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">William</span></span>

together; And for that End, bless and prosper His
Majesties Councils, and Forces by Sea and Land, and
these of the Princes and States his Allies, for God and
his Truth; That inferior Rulers may Rule in the fear
of God and Judges be cloathed with Righteousness,
and that many faithful Labourers may be sent out into
the Lord's Vineyard, and they who are sent, may find
mercy to be Faithful, and be blest with Success; That
Families may be as little Churches of Christ, and that
the Lord would pour out His Spirit on all Ranks of
People, that they may be Holy in all manner of Conversation,
and God may delight to dwell amongst us
and to do us good.

And while we pray for our selves, let us not forget
our Brethren in Foreign Churches, with whom, alas!
we had too little Sympathy; Nay let us pray, that all
the Ends of the Earth, may see the Salvation of God;
And that he would bring His ancient people of the

sincere and serious, in Humiliation and Supplication,
and universal Reformation, as they would wish to find
mercy of the Lord and have deserved wrath averted,

And Ordains all Ministers, either in Kirks or Meeting

Pulpit, a Sabbath or two before the said Day of Humiliation:
and that the several Presbyteries take care,
that it be carefully observed in their Respective bounds.
And where, in regard of Vacancies, the Day hereby
appointed, cannot be observed; The Assembly appoints
the said Humiliation to be kept some other Day
with the first convenient opportunity. And Appoints
the Commission for Visitation, to apply to the Council

The Happiness we have had by Your Majesties
influence, as an Instrument in the Hand of God,
towards us for good, and the Countenance You have
given us in Holding this National Assembly of the
Church of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scotland</span></span>, Doth Encourage us to make Application
again to Your Majesty; That as in our Answer
to Your Gracious Letter direct to us in the Entrance
of this Assembly, we Engaged to Your Majesty
that in all things that should come before us, we would
carry with that Calmnes and Moderation, which becometh
the Ministers of the Gospel of Peace, and which
Your Majesty did so effectually Recommend to us; So
now in the Close of this our Assembly, we presume to
acquaint Your Majesty, That through the good Hand
of God upon us, we have in a great measure performed
accordingly: Having applied our selves, mostly and
especially, to what concerned this whole Church, and
endeavoured by all means Ecclesiastical, and proper for
us, to promote the Good thereof, together with the
Quiet of the Kingdom, and Your Majesties Satisfaction
and Contentment. And God hath been pleased to
Bless our Endeavours, in our Receiving to the Unity
and Order of this Church, some who had withdrawn,
and now have joyned with us, and promised Subjection:

places of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Highlands</span></span>, which may be the surest
way of Reducing these people also unto Your Majesties
Obedience: And especially in Regulating the Ministers
of this Church, after so great Revolutions and
Alterations: For we have according to the use and
practice of this Church, ever since the first Reformation
from Popery, appointed Visitations both for the
Southern and Northern parts of this Kingdom, Consisting
of the Gravest and most Experienced Ministers
and Elders: To whom we have given Instructions about
the late Conformists, that none of them shall be
Removed from their Places, but such as are either Insufficient,
or Scandalous, or Erroneous, or Supinely Negligent:
And that these of them be admitted to Ministerial
Communion with us, who upon due Trial, and
in a Competent Time for that Trial, shall be found
to be Orthodox in Doctrine, of Competent Abilities,
of a Godly, Peaceable, and Loyal Conversation, and
who shall be judged Faithfull to God and to the Government:
And who shall likewayes Promise to own,
Submit unto, and Concurre with it. We have also
taken Care, that all persons, who shall be found to
have received wrong, in any Inferior Judicatory of this
Church, shall be duly Redressed: Other things which
are not of so Universal a Concern, we have delayed
till the next General Assembly. This Account Great
SIR, we look upon our selves as Obliged to give unto
Your Majesty, for that great Goodness, You have
been pleased to express, in giving such Countenance
to this Assembly, and in appointing such Commissioner
